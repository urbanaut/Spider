Robert Henri once said, “I am interested in art as a means of living a life; not as a means of making a living.” Fortunately for Jessica, she gets to do both. Jessica’s life has been art through music. She is an accomplished pianist, organist, and violinist. Jessica also loves orchestrating her home life; raising four children with her husband. After her children were all in school, Jessica decided to go back to school herself. While in school Jessica learned that art could be her means of making a living as well. Jessica found she had strengths in the field of development. She became particularly interested in mobile development.  Just as music is more than counting and rhythm; it involves melody and harmony – all coming together to create a musical score. With iOS and Android, it involves more than just coding; it has design, functionality, and user experience – all coming together to create a visibly appealing and functional app. Joining STG’s growing mobile team in 2012. Jessica began learning new skills, frameworks and tools; growing herself into a virtuoso in mobile as well as Java development. Jessica loves being able to keep things fresh with new projects while having a stable company to work for. Jessica is now helping to perform technical interviews for our mobile practice as well as helping clients build artistic and useful applications. Jessica’s creativity, artistry, and style help her to be a true artist in living her life and making a living.

A good QA truly lives by the motto: “leave things better than you found them.” Matt Chiang has always lived by this principle. Matt knows if you want to make something better, you must first understand the thing itself.  Understanding how something works in order to fix it and make it better started at a young age for Matt. Matt’s love of fixing things led him to learn about automobiles. Repairing, fixing and improving them has become a favorite pastime for him. When it became time to pick a career, Matt knew his passion for making things better than he found them would lend itself well to QA. After receiving his bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Matt spent several years at large corporations and small startups. He experienced extreme growth and the heartaches of downsizing. Looking for opportunities where he could share his knowledge and skills to help improve software applications, led Matt to STG in 2008.  Matt is the QA practice manager, helping to run our QA team. Matt helps to grow, train and perform technical evaluations for our employees. Matt is known to our clients as an extremely hardworking and brilliant QA. He doesn’t only understand QA, he understands software development as a whole. In order to help make applications better and to truly release software that works, one must understand the inner workings of the application. That is exactly what Matt does.  Matt is constantly working to improve his skills as well as helping those around him to grow their abilities. When Matt needs to get away, he finds himself with a fishing pole in his hand. The quite solitude of fishing helps him to rejuvenate and refresh his spirit.  Matt is dedicated to his work, fixing problems and finding solutions is his passion. Whatever Matt does he leaves it better than he found it. STG is definitely a better company because he is here.

Bryan Hansen is a champion. Whatever he decides to do, he excels at. He doesn’t excel because it’s easy, he excels because he works hard. A true champion uses any bump in the road as a stepping stone to propel them forward. That is exactly what Bryan does.  One of Bryan’s passions is competing in triathlons. There are several qualities of triathletes that make them successful. Bryan has utilized these skills to improve himself in his career and in training for triathlons.  Internal discipline give a triathlete the drive to train for success. Bryan developed internal discipline early on in his education. After almost completing a CIS degree, Bryan decided he wanted to have more than business experience, he wanted to develop. Switching majors to a CS degree took discipline and self-direction. Instead of looking at the short-term goal almost in reach of graduation, Bryan had the long-term vision of where he wanted to take his career. Following graduation, Bryan had a successful position as a programmer for an advertising agency. Bryan’s determination, consistency and focus allowed him to grow quickly. Bryan’s skill and energy drew him to a start-up company. Big dreams but poor planning led this company to failure – leaving Bryan without work.  Any triathlete knows how to deal with an obstacle, and Bryan saw this as an opportunity to grow. Bryan looked for a company with similar drive, passion, commitment, and discipline that he had. Joining STG in 2000, Bryan knew he had found a match.  Elite athletes train every day to become the best at what they do. Bryan took full advantage of the trainings and variety of projects available at STG, and became an elite programmer. Bryan’s enthusiasm for development is infectious. He mentors all those around him, whether they are candidates, clients, or employees.  Merging his business knowledge with his wealth of development expertise, Bryan rapidly moved into leadership roles at STG. Now, as the director of practice management, Bryan oversees all of our practices. He makes sure all of our employees are receiving the training, development, and mentorship that make STG great. He also helps to architect applications, solve problems, and provide direction for our clients. Because of his work ethic and skill, our clients request him by name. They know the quality of work and help they will receive when he is on a project.  Mark Allen a six time Ironman champion once said, “Until you face your fears, you don’t move to the other side, where you find the power.” That is exactly what Bryan does – Bryan moves beyond fear, disappointment and excuses. Bryan embodies the true qualities of an athlete: discipline, commitment, the ability to overcome, and the love of what you do. Giving your all and helping to lift those along the way is the sign of a true leader. That is what makes Bryan a true champion developer, mentor, director, triathlete, husband and father.  We are so glad that he is part of our team and helps us reach further, farther and faster.

Whether he is gliding in his boat across a lake with his family, climbing unknown Jeep trails seeking undiscovered wonders in the desert, or analyzing complex lines of code to increase efficiency and effectiveness; Jason is an explorer. Exploring a friends’ new computer at 8 years old first sparked Jason’s interest in computer engineering. Jason was fascinated by seeing what he could get the computer to do. Jason learned that the possibilities are endless if you know the right code. After spending several years in a different field, Jason longed for the adventure of software development. As Jason examined his career options, he wanted to work somewhere that allowed him to discover, create, and grow. After searching, Jason found STG. It was a great fit. Jason joined STG in 2008, he is known for his ability to help clients to solve difficult problems and create meaningful solutions. Jason’s love of learning has allowed him to grow his skills and become the senior developer he is today.

Jason also helps to mentor STG’s current employees to grow and develop their own skills. He also helps with skill assessments and training for the STG Java Practice.  As much as Jason loves exploring the world of software development, nothing compares to how much he loves his wife and two children. Exploring life with them is the ultimate adventure.

They began the process of trying to move over 200 applications from C# with Visual Studio.  The ramp-up time for their team was slow and they missed some urgent deadlines. Hiring some outside help was an option, but they had trepidation. Their fear was if someone came in and wrote the software and then left, leaving them little or no knowledge as to how it was written. After meeting with the team from STG, they explained our model and calmed their fears. STG recommended bringing on an expert, Dave Thresher. Dave came in and helped them immediately get some quick apps out the door. He then spent the next few months training and working side by side with their programmers getting them up to speed. Dave was able to assess the current employees’ level of understanding and helping them grow from the level they currently were at. Davis County was thrilled with Dave’s motivation and dedication to the project. If Dave saw anything that would work better or if they had a problem that they couldn’t figure out, Dave would go to work on his own and research solutions. Dave aided them in developing their own standards for programming and helping them find the correct tools to use. Davis County has utilized Dave for over a year and a half. He has migrated from being the main man and training their staff to a team programmer allowing them to put their team in charge. Davis County is now back on schedule! STG was able to help them to get them on track, train their employees to be able to maintain what was built, and help with best practices.

Background CR England is a family owned and operated business founded in 1920. They are the largest temperature-controlled carrier in the world. CR England is dedicated to providing a comprehensive range of transportation solutions to their clients. CR England is known for their quality of service as well as their emphasis on caring for their employees. Solution STG was brought on initially to help CR England with an out-of-date Java website. The old site used JSP’s and JDBC – the separation of the MVC layers was virtually non-existent. STG started by setting up a proper automated build process. STG was able to demonstrate efficient ways to write and test code before it was deployed to production. STG enabled the client to quickly come up to speed with modern Java development practices.     


URL: http://stgconsulting.com/project/nuskin/
Background NuSkin was founded in Provo, Utah in 1984. As a premier anti-aging skin care company, NuSkin lives by its philosophy, “all of the good, none of the bad.” The company markets its products in 53 international markets through a network of over 950,000 independent distributors. In 2010, NuSkin was listed among Forbes “100 Most Trustworthy Companies.” As the company moves forward into the future, they are dedicated to producing innovation, integrity, and setting the standard in their industry. Solution STG has recently helped NuSkin in two major areas: Mobile development and QA. STG consultants worked closely with the NuSkin developers to build a point of sale application that interfaces with a hand held device. Most recently, STG has been working on improving NuSkin’s mobile code base, bringing it current and in line with iOS and Android standards. STG consultants also developed libraries and modules that can be used in future apps to speed up development and standardize certain types of functionality. Our QA specialists built an automation framework from the ground up using Webdriver, Java, TestNG, and Maven to test shopping and monthly auto shopping for all 54 markets. Automation also includes verification of shopping and all the pages for 12 microsites along with the corporate website. STG helped to build an automation reporting web app using Ruby on Rails that facilitates automated testing with logging of all test results. Our team built an automation that tests ten web services; reducing the manual effort of product verification from six people taking roughly half an hour to complete – to three people less than ten minutes. STG’s senior QA helped to teach the NuSkin QA group Java development as well as Webdriver automation so they could continue to write automation that would be effective and efficient for the company.     


URL: http://stgconsulting.com/project/deer-valley/
Background In 2011 Deer Valley Resort Management recognized the need for a full web site redesign. The inhouse web development team didn’t have the knowledge and skills to handle this demanding project on their own. STG was approached to work with Deer Valley to both rebuild the site and provide training and mentoring for the internal web development team. The Marketing team, an outside design agency, the internal development team worked together with a Senior Architect from STG to plan and implement the new website architecture and design using the Microsoft .net framework. The ski industry has many service providers who’ve developed solutions that work for a standard resort. But Deer Valley has unique customers with specific needs. An out of the box solutions was not capable of delivering the functionality and user experience that Deer Valley required. Solution The goals and timeline for completing the new website were ambitious and required working with a number of stakeholders within the company. The Lead Architect from STG managed the project from end-to-end while training and mentoring the in-house web development team. The new design has been tremendously successful. Revenue from the website has increased year over year. Guests can now access all retail aspects of the resort website through a single user profile. And the number of phone calls to the lodging reservation center have dropped significantly due to the easy to use rental property. View Site     


URL: http://stgconsulting.com/project/wcf/
Background Worker’s Compensation Fund’s mission is to provide exceptional workers compensation insurance services to their policyholders, business partners, workers, and the others they serve. They have an uncompromising commitment to everything they do. Solution STG was initially brought in to WCF to train their current staff on new technologies. After our initial training, STG has now been involved in helping to fix existing applications to stabilize production issues, migrating old data from LDAP and DB2 to a new security model, and upgrading security model to use CAS and implementing single sign on across new and existing applications. STG developed and coauthored an application augmented with WCF staff to help with the technology handoff. Establishing a new development stack with current best practices, and mentoring WCF staff on the new stack enabled WCF to maintain and continue on with the same development practices that were implemented.

It takes someone with many talents and interests to successfully direct the operations of a dynamic company like STG. Fortunately, we have the perfect person in Michele Stone. In 1987, after stints as a massage therapist and a certified nurse assistant, which bolstered her passion for helping people, she got into the software game at WordPerfect. In 2002, Michele, along with her husband and her brother, launched her own IT consulting and staffing firm, which quickly grew into a global IT services company. In 2014, not long after selling her company, Michele came to work for STG. Her background in software makes her extremely knowledgeable about the technical aspects of the industry, but Michele is also passionate about the people behind the systems and has built a strong sense of community among her team. She is currently working on a degree in psychology from the University of Utah, which will further her understanding of people and how to best utilize their strengths. Michele believes that a commitment to work/life balance leads to better productiveness at work and greater satisfaction in life. She takes advantage of her time away from the office by spending it with her husband and four children—up on the slopes at Alta or enjoying a vacation at some far-flung location.

Chick is amazing at building relationships with our clients, especially over a game of golf. When Chick was younger he dreamed of being a pro golfer. When Chick isn’t golfing, farming, or working here at STG – he can be found with his guitar. Music is a great escape when life is stressful. Chick loves working for a company that cares about their employees and always does the right thing. Chick is a talented account manager and mentor for those around him. We are so grateful to have all Chick’s talent on our team.

Greg Gerber is hard to pin down. It’s not that he is mysterious in any way, just that he’s always on the go. His active lifestyle starts at home, where, with he, his wife, daughter, three horses, two dogs, two chickens, and a cat, all going in million different directions, there’s never a dull moment. Greg’s recreational pursuits, including mountain biking, ATVing, and camping, also keep him on the move. And Greg doesn’t slow down when it comes to work. His tireless energy propels him forward at all times. In his past jobs at consulting firms and global corporate organizations, Greg has been involved in helping to place thousands of professionals in successful and rewarding positions. He received BA degrees in both psychology and business management from Luther College in Iowa, so he has a great knowledge of both people and procedures, making him a particularly adept leader. Since joining STG in December of 2014, Greg has kept things hopping, finding immense satisfaction in watching people grow, develop, and flourish in their careers—people who would probably like to thank him for the role he has played in their success, if only they could get him to stand still for a moment.

These labels may not be well-known.    Whether it is our left hemisphere that is more dominant or our right one, the distinction can impact our personality and the decisions we make. Each hemisphere of the brain is dominant for different behaviors. If you would split the brain right down the middle into two symmetrical or equal parts, you would have a right and left hemisphere. Although equal in size, these two sides are not the same, and do not carry out the same functions.  The left side of the brain is responsible for controlling the right side of the body. It also performs tasks that have to do with logic, such as in science and mathematics.  On the other hand, the right hemisphere coordinates the left side of the body, and performs tasks that have do with creativity and the arts.  Both hemispheres are connected by the corpus callosum and serve the body in different ways. There are a lot of quizzes and you can test yourself to see which one you are.   Here is a link to just one of them: http://www.web-us.com/brain/braindominance.htm   Now a bit about me. I love math. My major in high school was Physics and Mathematics Science. In college I studied computer science. I am able to speak three languages, Persian, Japanese and English. I am right handed. So I should be a left-brained. Right? We human are such amazing creatures. We still don’t know so much about our brain. I’ve heard it said that we use less than 10% of our brain’s capacity. Have you ever felt that you have an urge to do something for yourself but you don’t know what it is. Have you ever felt that urge drive you crazy sometimes? I am not talking about the urge to have a big cheese hamburger (which, truth be told, does drive me crazy sometimes.) When we feel these urges, some of us may know what it is and we go for it, some of us may need a trigger to take us there. I was the latter one. I tried to find my hidden urge by doing writing, painting on canvas or paper, or learning music. I still felt there must be something else inside me that must be hiding. It was May 21 2015, I came back home from work with a lot of anger, and frustrated feelings. I tried to watch TV, to distract myself, it didn’t work. I tried to eat junk food to distract myself, and it didn’t work either. I couldn’t stop to switch off my brain not to think what had happened at work. Like a zombie I sat behind my computer and opened the MS Paint app. I grabbed the mouse and moved it fiercely around and around. I saw the cursor on my screen moving in every direction, creating lines without any clear shapes. I grabbed that black mouse like I was sitting on the back of a black dragon that was going to take me anywhere, everywhere. That dragon took me to the top of rainbow arch, to the bottom of ocean, among the flowers or on the silver moon. I felt I could touch everything that I wanted to. I could kiss the moon and kick the rainbow arch to see how those beautiful colors like soft powders were pouring on my screen. I could even feel the breeze of air through my hair. Inside of me I was screaming and laughing loudly like a child; I was happy and felt free. My black dragon came and rescued me from darkness. I painted and painted and painted, I didn’t know for how many hours. My eyelids were heavier and the pain in my wrist from moving the mouse around and around pushed me to look at the clock on the corner of my screen. It said 2:00 in the morning! Every part of my body was tired, but my brain didn’t want to stop; my brain still wanted to dance and sing with that dragon. The cursor was moving faster than ever, lines showing clear shapes more than ever. This morphine of painting was in my blood and giving me so much pleasure that I didn’t even care about time or my pain and my exhausted body. My brain now was telling me about my hidden urge. Yes that’s it, I had found it. In two months I painted almost 80 pictures and showed them to everyone that I knew, from families to friends. I’ve come to realize that painting gives me a lot of pleasure and joy that I wish I could explain it to you.   Given all of what I’ve shared, you may have wondered what the result of the brain test was for me.: It said that I am both; left and right brained. As developers or designers we may be stereotyped into one class or another. In my opinion, I don’t believe people are Left OR Right brained. I believe all of us are both left AND right brained and we should explore both sides to find what makes us happy. What do you think?

Author: Chris Lake   One of the ways that STG likes to partner with its clients is to sit in as an observer when we have a candidate interview.  We don’t interfere with anything said, but being in the room helps us observe and see both how the candidate does and what needs our client has that perhaps we had not thought to consider in our candidate search.  It really is a great opportunity. One of the results of sitting in so many interviews is that I get to see many different interview styles and situations.  I’ve seen some candidates just rock the interview and I’ve seen others blow it so badly that it’s almost physically painful to sit and watch them struggle.   Although we never share specific interview questions from clients, I’ve noticed a few specific suggestions and ideas that I think every person going through a technical interview should be aware of.  PAY ATTENTION to the items below—they may just land you that dream job!  There’s no way I could cover everything in a quick blog, but here are just a couple of the big ones. It’s often said that you never get a second chance to make a first impression.  I’ve heard that it takes typically less than 7 seconds for that first impression to be formed.  A lot can go into making those 7 seconds count:   Often in a technical interview, they will ask you to go up to a white board and write out a solution to a technical problem.  Even if you’ve seen this other people do this a hundred times, when it’s you standing up, it’s almost guaranteed that the pressure of the moment will cause a strange effect of having your intelligence shut off as soon as your knees lock and you lift the marker to write.  It happens to the best of them (and that includes you!)  Here’s a couple tips to keep in mind:   At the end of almost every interview, you will be asked “So, what questions do you have for us?”  Before the interview, you should make a list of questions that you’d like to ask that don’t make you sound like an idiot or someone who doesn’t care enough to ask a real question.  Here are some common good topics:   HOWEVER, the most important question you NEED TO ASK is some variation of the following: This question is of utmost importance because if the interviewers have any concerns regarding your experience and you cannot overcome their concerns, you probably will not have a chance of landing this job or being asked back for a second interview. This is a great question and has often turned a negative interview into a positive one—Sell yourself.  It’s amazing how you can clear up misperceptions that otherwise would have sunk you as a candidate.     Once the interview is over, make sure you thank them for their time, shake their hands like you mean it and walk away like a professional.  You will have just been through an experience together and you may feel an urge to confess some deeply personal thing to your new found buddy as you walk out together.  Please don’t.  Unless they ask about it, now is not the time to start sharing about your personal life and what crazy plans you have for the weekend.  You’ve aced the interview.  Don’t leave them with a question mark in their minds. Make sure you follow up within 24 hours with a quick note (email is fine) thanking them for the opportunity and reiterating why you feel you are a great fit for the spot.  Since you already have their card from the beginning of the interview, it should just take a few minutes of your time.  This one thing can help set you apart from the pile of others they talk to and help you be remembered. There is nothing here that is rocket science and nothing you’ve probably not heard before.  However, hopefully these few tips will help you turn your next interview into your next position!     Author: Chris Lake   Are you Left Brained or Right Brained?

Author: Geoffrey Sagers   I recently had the opportunity to attend the RootsTech Genealogy conference held in Salt Lake City, Utah. One of the sessions I attended was the Innovator Showdown. It was the final six of numerous of entries to “show off” how technology can improve family history — the world’s largest org chart. Most people think of family history as old books in dusty libraries, cemeteries, huge stacks of papers, and the county clerk’s office. However, the finalists included medical history tracking, hardware-software combination using iPhone technology, data visualization, and digital record-keeping. Each finalist shared the technology they used for their platform and some common threads emerged. TapGenes uses software to map likelihood of certain genetic traits that could affect other family members such as cancers, chromosomal diseases and heart/stroke risks. This information can then be used by families to create a specific roadmap for testing when they go in for general physicals and diseases could be caught much sooner. Software technologies used: facebook api, gmail api, family search api.  AncestorCloud created a portal to allow genealogy-related services on-demand. Want someone to take a picture of a headstone in a far-away cemetery? Need a tour guide when you visit the small little town where great-grandma was born? These and so much more are available when using their service, and users could sign up to be a provider as well to earn some money. Software technologies used: react.js, node.js, redux, mongodb, javascript, amazon-web-services  JRNL is an online journal-keeping application. Using social and personal media, you can keep a running journal of your daily life. You become your own curator of the museum of your life, marking facebook postings as noteable, removing others completely. They also provided the ability to print to a book, so you have a hard copy for yourself or children/grandchildren. Software technologies used: reactjs, django, node.js, mariadb, elasticsearch, redis, xamarin, redux  Studio by Legacy Republic was a scanner built specifically for photo albums where often the size or deterioration of physical medium represents a risk to the quality of reproduction available. Using a system not much bigger than a suitcase, a user can quickly photograph in high resolution, hundreds of photos in an album to pass along to future generations in a non-degrading quality. Software technologies used: xcode, ios, swift, bluetooth, wifi, linux, raspberry-pi  The History Project came from the founder’s desire to share experiences with others using historical context. His father had died of cancer when the founder was just 13 and he wanted to “walk in his shoes.” It started by him wanting to pass his experience visiting where his father grew up and spent his time to his children and siblings. Using a mixture of photographs, news articles, videos and other media, he was able to create a rich experience for those who were unable to take the trip with him. He founded The History Project to create the opportunity for others to create these same personal experiences for their loved ones. Software technologies used: laravel/php, facebook and instagram api, google api, vimeo, amazon web services  Twile was based on data visualization rather than facts/figures. Specifically a user could upload a file of their family history data (GEDCOM), and create a timeline of family member events. Birth, death, christening, etc. and then add to it your own photos and eventually audio and video. This made viewing this same information much more enjoyable and sometimes-hidden events much more obvious. Software technologies used: javascript, backbone.js, asp.net, sql-server, node.js   Bubbling to the top of the most used technologies were javascript and javascript frameworks such as node, backbone, and react. Also popular were both sql and nosql databases. The judges chose TapGenes as the winner, but Twile and Studio also received innovation awards. What was surprising is the number of companies with less than 10 employees that were making enterprise-level applications. This proved to me that less can be more, and throwing more money at a problem doesn’t necessarily solve it, but more technology and people often can. Many problems that used to be insurmountable are now attainable by people from all walks of life.   Author: Geoffrey Sagers Are you Left Brained or Right Brained?

Author: Ryan Parrish As a consultant, often when diving into a large online retailer environment you can expect there to be many pieces of proprietary company knowledge to pick up. Between learning a new API, using Foreign CRM tools, and adapting to the conventions of their business operations and hierarchy expectations, it can be a lot to keep track of.  In doing so recently at Backcountry.com, I was able to help strengthen their business with immediate solutions and leverage my position as a consultant to speak the truth without any political or superior ties. This put me in a great position that harnessed a relationship based on trust and helped push toward the company’s progression in their development.  Specifically, I was tasked with maintaining a new web series they’ve started called ‘collections’. I came on at week two of their launch and was helping to maintain these weekly releases while a team in Costa Rica was building a tool that automated the process. After producing one collection:  http://www.backcountry.com/sc/bottoms-up  I realized that I never wanted to maintain these pages the way that they had in mind. There has to be a better way, I thought. So after a few conversations with some engineers and a couple days passed, I cobbled together a PHP based solution that effectively generated an entire ‘collection’ page just by passing in a set of product SKU arrays. Take that!  Make the computer do the work. Don’t be a developer doing production work.  Essentially, I developed a slightly less robust tool than the team in Costa Rica. But you know what? It took a few days and was getting implemented in a real world fashion right out of the gate.  Not to dog what their team in Costa Rica built (which ended up being pretty amazing in its own right) but I think the multiple job offers speak loud enough.   Author: Ryan Parrish Are you Left Brained or Right Brained?

URL: http://stgconsulting.com/coding-html-emails/
Author: Patricia Johnson Like me, you probably expect that html code is going to display virtually the same in every browser, with a few known exceptions. There are small foibles in rendering between the assorted web browsers, but with every update, those differences become fewer and fewer, and the CSS “hacks” for these issues are well-known and widely used. Until the first time you’re assigned to program an HTML email. Oh, it looks easy enough, and often it doesn’t even have to be responsive, so you quickly code the email, checking in all the browsers for inconsistencies, and then send it off the test email. And then it explodes in your face. What was beautiful HTML code in your web browser has arrived in your inbox looking like something straight out of Geocities, circa 1996. What happened?!   Email clients seem to have a free pass on W3C standards compliance and implementation To some degree, every existing email client has varying, but never complete, W3C standards compliance in their html rendering engine. Some are pretty close (Apple and iOS) and some seem to be thumbing their nose at the W3C and making rude hand gestures at developers everywhere (Outlook 2011 uses IE as its html rendering engine, but every other version, including 2016, uses MS Word). Because of this, developers often flail about virtually, and sometimes actually, when coding their first emails. None of the things you can take for granted when coding a webpage seem to be true, when it comes to programming for email. And since there’s no way of knowing until after the fact which email client your recipient is using, you have to code your email for the least common denominator. Just pretend it’s 1999, and you should be fine.   First off, you can stop making that face. There’s no getting around it. I know, if your web portfolio was written like this, you could expect not just to not get the job, but to perhaps be laughed out of the interviewer’s office, and maybe even hear some four-letter words for having wasted their time, on the way out. But this isn’t a webpage, it’s an email, so just grit your teeth and bear it.   Say goodbye to stylesheets Due to potential security issues, emails will not allow you to reference an external stylesheet, no matter where you host it. And because Gmail does not support <style> tags, in either the head or body of an email, every bit of CSS you write for the desktop view must be an inline style. Fortunately, there are several free tools available online to help with your inline style needs. Campaign Monitor’s CSS Inliner  or Zurb’s Ink allow you to write a <style> tag in the head of your html document – when the time comes to deliver the email, you will copy and paste your code into their tool, which will then add the CSS not found inside media queries (more on responsive emails in a later post) to your html code as inline styles. Just a tip – I would save the version for delivery out as a separate file. It makes it a lot easier to tweak your code, should you find any bugs (and you will) after that first test send.   Say Hello to Deprecated, Ugly, Tangled Code While you can use modern HTML and CSS for much of your email, there are a few common elements you won’t want to use, either because it will make adding responsive code easier later if you don’t, or because it simply is not supported in one or more of the major email clients. The first major difference is that divs won’t work for layout anymore. You must go back to using tables to create your grid. Don’t forget to add “cellspacing=’0’ cellpadding=’0’” to every <table> declaration, or Outlook and its incarnations (Hotmail, Outlook.com) are going to add a seemingly random amount of padding and space to your table elements, throwing your design off in a rather spectacular manner. You also want to declare your dimensions in the “td” tags, but not with css – use “width=x” and “height=x”, without “px” after the number. This both prevents box-model issues and makes it much easier to change the dimensions in your media queries, should you use them later. And speaking of Outlook, it doesn’t recognize the “padding” property for p, div and a tags, so you’re going to have to use nested tables with padding added to the <td> tags for your white space needs. To make this an even bigger slap in the face, Outlook.com doesn’t support “margin” at all, so it’s more nested tables to the rescue. Outlook also doesn’t recognize images as block level elements by default,  so every <img> must have “display: block” in its style tag, as well as “border=’0’” in its attributes if it’s part of a link, in order to get them to sit where you want them, and not have big blue borders. “Float” is no longer an option, which is why you need tables for columns. If you need something to move to the left or right of something – for example, an image, placed to the right of a paragraph- you’ll need to use “align=’right’” in the image tag. JavaScript is universally stripped from emails at the receiving end, in order to prevent virus transmission, and for the same reason, background images are also inaccessible. So if your designer provides you with a lovely photograph with copy on top, the whole thing will have to be cut as an image, text and all. This is alright for a header banner, but occasionally you get a client who wants to be able to edit their headers (if you’re programming a branded template, for example), so you’ll have to send the design back to the drawing board, so to speak. “Live text”, as it were, needs a solid colored background behind it – usually that’s white, but any other solid color that may be specified with CSS can also be used. Thanks to Outlook (again), you will have to re-declare your font statements – font-family, color, font-size, line-height – every time you add another nested table – it will not inherit past a “table” tag. If you are using one of the inlining tools I linked to previously, you may want to add those declarations to the td, p and a elements, to be sure they are always correct. Otherwise Outlook will pretend you’ve never mentioned font styles, and will serve up times new roman, in black, at the default font-size for the recipients’ version of the client. Additionally, you need to declare font-size and color in every <h> element, now that Outlook.com wants to apply its own formatting to headlines. If you don’t want your h1 tags to be green (I’m not exaggerating – Outlook.com makes all h1 tags green by default), you need to specify what color they should be, even if the color is already declared elsewhere (for example, in the surrounding td tag).   Email Best Practices Your email should be roughly 600px wide at its maximum resolution, responsive or not. This prevents side-scrolling in most desktop email clients, and also prevents too much white-space around the email in the reading pane. Do use white space appropriately. Huge blocks of text are hard to read – remember to break up paragraphs with a little spacing in between, and have some padding between columns, if you used them. Do use a web-safe font – you can’t call to a font server in an email, just like you can’t call out to an external style sheet. Georgia and Verdana are easy on the eyes, with Arial and Helvetica a close second. Always add a fallback to your font-family declarations – “Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif” will make sure no one accidentally gets Times New Roman, even if they don’t have Verdana, Arial or Helvetica. It will save the readers’ eyes, and your design aesthetics. The only exception to the above rule is if you’re programming an email intended solely for internal corporate use, and the font in question is their corporate brand font – it’s safe to assume that everyone in the company will have that font installed on their work computer. Still provide the fallback fonts, because more than half those people are likely to open that email on a personal mobile device, which may not be able to access that font, at one time or another.   Keep font sizes at 12px or larger if at all possible. Not only are smaller fonts hard to read on a mobile device, but the Apple email clients will “fix that” for you by blowing up tiny fonts to a larger, more mobile-friendly size – but will not adjust the line-height, so your text may be squished or even have overlapping lines. Optimize your images for file size, and if you’re the designer, try to use no more than 6 per email. Images increase load time on emails, and studies have shown that even increasing load time by a few seconds can dramatically increase the rate of deleting said email before it ever opens, especially on mobile devices. Gmail and some of the other email clients count the number of images in your email, and may flag your email as potential spam if it has more than half a dozen images. Always supply alt tags for your images, for use by screen readers, and hard code the dimensions using the width and height attributes of the img tag, so your layout isn’t askew if the email loads with images disabled by default. Those descriptive alt tags will help get your message across as you intended it, even if the viewer never downloads the images. Tinypng.org offers a free, web-based png and jpeg compression tool that can cut your file sizes by an average of 30 – 75% or more, with no visible loss of quality.   And lastly… Remember that unless you’re creating an OFT (Outlook Format Template) or EML file only as the deliverable, your images are not embedded in your file, and the images must be hosted online somewhere, with absolute paths in the html to reference them. Email testing services like Email On Acid or Litmus will save you time and prevent frustration-induced baldness. These services allow you to send a test email to a single email address, upload a zipped file with your html and images, or copy and paste your html code (or all 3), and then shows you a screenshot of how your email looks on arrival in almost every email client conceivable. This is especially valuable if you’re programming responsive emails, but it is always good to see how your email holds up on Apple Mail vs an Android phone vs Gmail in Chrome vs Outlook 2011, whether it is responsive or not. You can quickly check and recheck for any client specific errors in your email with these services, so that the email files you deliver are bulletproof, whatever their format – without having to own an extensive testing lab of computers. There are numerous quality resources online for learning more about the pitfalls of programming emails. The blogs at Campaign Monitor, EmailOnAcid, Litmus, and Mail Chimp are full of extremely helpful information when it comes to troubleshooting your particular email issue.     Author: Patricia Johnson Are you Left Brained or Right Brained?

Author: Neal Jenks Design Consultant | IxD Practice Manager   Ah, end-of-year: The time when a young man/woman’s fancy turns to lists. I asked Software Technology Group’s illustrious IxD Practice members to share some of their favorite UX/UI discoveries from the past year. What followed was an entertaining and instructive mixed-bag of websites, apps, and more. Enjoy!   InVision  invisionapp.com The free prototyping tool that UX designers love just keeps getting better and better. InVision has now extended well beyond hot-linking comps to terrific animations and transitions, cross-platform support, project management, development hand-off tools and more. And dang are those features easy to use. I consider InVision to be one of the best web-based apps of all time.   Typeform typeform.com Boring forms move aside. Here’s a form generator with a simple, robust interface that creates gorgeous, user-friendly forms. Survey Monkey, you have been shamed.   Snowbird snowbird.com Okay, so it’s not responsive yet, but the website for Snowbird Ski Resort demonstrates the power of branding, design consistency, and beautiful, purposeful animation. To see what I mean, check out the great snow report side-bar animation. I love me some accordion-fold action.   Google Play – Music play.google.com/music Google Material Design standards are slowly taking over the look, feel, and functionality of the Internet, and their music player shows why. Bold, purposeful and fun, this app makes finding music intuitive, user-centered, and insanely easy. Watch your back iTunes.   Wikiwand wikiwand.com The world’s most popular Wikipedia reader has so much respect for the content and the user, it’s disgusting. Wikiwand shows us that, when the interface takes the back seat in the experience, it’s a sign of elegance, not acquiescence.    Epicurrence.com epicurrence.com For those with a strong aversion to design for design’s sake, avert your eyes. For the rest of you, behold and rejoice. The multiple scroll rates tied to each graphic, the beautiful typography, the limited palette—all of these come together to form a single, cohesive piece that entices one to flick the ol’ scroll wheel again and again.   Domo.com domo.com This has to be one of my favorite corporate websites. Do yourself a favor: Click and drag the bottom-right corner of your browser window to see a responsive/adaptive design done right. Each break point, each grid, each resized image speaks of craftsmanship and attention to detail. This is screen optimization at its highest.  Wire wire.com In the world awash in messaging applications, some absolute gems have been overlooked. Such is, unfortunately, the case with Wire. Here at last is a gorgeous messaging app that just works right: HD voice quality, quick image uploads, and a lot more. The layouts, the huge graphics, the customization—all bespeak refinement and appreciation for the user. Now if only Wire could find some users to return the favor.   Oakley Airbrake MX moto.oakley.com The site loads horrifically slow, but to the patient, the spoils. Behold the full power of parallax scrolling: Not just for wow-factor, but for a ponderously perfect product demo. Here is a site not content to merely blow your mind and let it be. Oakley has put together a masterpiece of marketing. Prepare to pine for impact-resistant goggles.   Inception Explained inception-explained.com It’s a cool visual representation of a cool movie. Deal with it.   There’s our thoroughly informal and certified-awesome list. What did we get right? What did we miss? Email neal.jenks@stgconsulting.com and let me know.   Author: Neal Jenks Design Consultant | IxD Practice Manager Are you Left Brained or Right Brained?

Author: Neal Jenks   Allow me to wax prophetic. A vibrant, waning year tends to open our imaginations to the unexplored horizons yet to come, and this is especially true of the IxD world.  If the past year has taught us anything, it is that we have absolutely no clue what to expect. But heck… that just makes conjecture more fun. So…come along as I attempt to follow our current, cryptic trajectories into an unknown and exciting future. Let the wild speculations commence!   Sketch vs. Illustrator Wars Mark my words: Adobe Illustrator has a new Bohemian contender. In 2016, Sketch is ready to put down a beating on the World Heavyweight Vector-Graphics Champion. Why? First and foremost, it’s cheaper. A $99 flat fee vs. $49 per month for Creative Cloud is hard to ignore. And it’s ALMOST as powerful as Illustrator. I’m still learning about Sketch, but the Art Board controls are much slicker and plug-ins, like the content generator, kick some serious butt. Best of all is Sketch’s seamless integration with other applications. InVision offers real-time syncing with Sketch files. Make an update in Sketch, and your Invision prototypes reflect those updates instantly. Zeplin works beautifully with Sketch files as well. Forget spending countless hours creating UI pattern libraries and communicating with developers about your work. Upload your Sketch files to Zeplin, and you’re pretty much done. The only area where Sketch seems to be a little behind is in pure vector editing. That being said, keep your eye on Sketch. It floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee.   One Material Design to Rule Them All Watch your back, Mac. Material Design is poised to take over the world this year. When creating a native iOS or Android app, it’s important to be an upstanding citizen in that space. In other words, if you’re creating an iOS app, it should look like an iOS app. To help IxDs model good citizenship, Apple has provided Human Interface Guidelines. For Google/Android, there’s Material Design. Material Design standards attempt to define all Google’s branding across all of its properties, from layout and typography to UI patterns and components. In the process, they’ve created a style guide that is simple, intentional, easy to apply across various products, and, in their own words, “delightful.” In my estimation, they’ve largely succeeded. As Material Design continues its meteoric rise, Human Interface seems to be floundering. Always considered a bastion of hope and adoration by designers worldwide, now Apple design standards are under active attack. No longer a sacred cow, Bruce Tognazzini and Don Norman recently tore Apple a new one, accusing them of losing their way, designing for design’s sake, and focusing inwardly rather than on users. In today’s user-focused digital space, Material Design just makes more sense, and I predict that it will slowly envelop our design consciousness to the exclusion of all else.   Lean UX Getting Leaner Clients and companies all want to create more from less, and for some reason, UX always stands out as a target for attrition. So UX will get leaner this year. The question is: In what way? I attended a Lean UX workshop, and I was shocked to learn that “lean” to the presenter definitely wasn’t lean to me. For example, he kept his UX cost down by doing fewer focus groups with fewer people when testing. On my team, we go even leaner, sending out surveys periodically in order to inform our decisions on a feature, or conducting very small focus groups ONLY WHEN there’s significant question about an interaction. We also rely heavily on our application’s User Feedback section. He also focused on creating much lower fidelity prototypes for stakeholders — using what looked like InVision. Once again, my team takes lean prototyping even further. I generally tell an interactive “story” with a series of non-interactive comps viewed in order. So who of us struck the appropriate balance between and efficiency and efficacy? Who knows. I predict that, in 2016, we’ll spend a lot more time answering questions like this.   The Great Rapid Prototyping Conflict of our Time When technology is new and demand is high, multiple solution providers always vie for top-honors. When it comes to prototyping tech, our clear-cut front runner remains undecided. This year, a leader may finally emerge. InVision is certainly one of, if not the most, commonly used prototyping application today. However, common usage hardly denotes a front-runner. Despite awesome features like improved animations and transitions, cross-platform support, real-time collaboration, etc., designers still pine for more robust offerings. Axure Pro provides more robust features than InVision, but at $589 per license, many clients still deem free InVision “good enough.” Several impressive image-to-code tools are also waiting their turn in the limelight: Macaw and Pixate in particular. And for those in love with code, don’t forget the power of customization inherent in front-end frameworks like Bootstrap. Who will emerge triumphant from the maelstorm?

By Quinn Heiner   In this article (which has no relation to Covey’s famous book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, except maybe the number seven), we will take a different approach in our discussion of good habits by first pointing out the bad ones.  By going from ineffective to effective, we will essentially discover what really separates good engineers from the exceptional.   #1: Don’t ever try to re-balance the time-scope-quality triangle.   If you do, be sure to never articulate this tradeoff to the customer.  More importantly, be sure to ignore  Murphy’s three laws: 1) everything takes longer than you think, 2) nothing is as easy as it looks, and 3) if something can go wrong, it will.  By doing this, you’ll ensure that a product will be delivered late, have way too many features than originally agreed upon, and be full of bugs (not to mention way over budget).  In addition, the customer (who fortunately has a great sense of humor) will have a good laugh and you’ll both be on your merry way to the next project. But seriously.  Although this triangle sometimes autocorrects by force, far too many engineers think that this triangle is the PM’s problem (project or product manager).  Honestly, it should be both your problems.  You as a developer are closer to the product’s internals than anyone else, and it is your responsibility to regularly communicate the current state of the triangle to your managers and recommend re-balancing strategies. Certainly, the biggest problem with analyzing this triangle is that managers tend to use the wrong data to assess progress.  That is, they only use timeline and budget as their indicators of progress, when they ought to be incorporating user stories and user acceptance tests as a better indicator.  To summarize, people in charge tend to view the time-scope-quality triangle as more of a time-scope-resources triangle, when resources != quality.  In reality, not all resources are created equal, and so often times it’s four variables you should take into account, not three: A great article on a shirky.com web blog talked about why healthcare.gov failed and applied it to I.T. projects in general.  A quote from it that I really liked, “If I had to design a litmus test…[for managing I.T. projects, and we’ll talk about litmus tests more in habit 4]…I would look for just one signal: Can anyone with authority over a new project articulate the tradeoff between features, quality, and time?” “When a project cannot meet all three goals—a situation Healthcare.gov was clearly in—something will give. If you want certain features at a certain level of quality, you’d better be able to move the deadline. If you want overall quality by a certain deadline, you’d better be able to simplify, delay, or drop features. And if you have a fixed feature list and deadline, quality will suffer.” The most common scenario in my experience is scope creep with decreasing time–therefore quality has to suffer, or you have to suffer putting in crazy hours to meet a deadline.  It doesn’t have to be this way. Sometimes we have to learn to say “no” even if something is feasible, even reasonable.  Other times, we have to stretch ourselves and say “yes” even if we know it may take some effort.   Question for discussion: What are some strategies or tactics you’ve employed to keep this triangle balanced and happy?   #2: Only choose battles you will lose. Time isn’t precious, and so if you know you’re going up against “the man”, or a brick wall of politics, or stubborn customers, keep fighting until you finally lose.  Always try to be the martyr, because nothing feels better than telling someone “I told you so!  I warned you about this!” afterward.  Speaking of battles…why even start one?  Just code a bunch of stuff that affects a bunch of other stuff and do not tell anyone. But seriously.  Don’t get me wrong on this, you are a consultant and should be actively involved in the decision-making process, and as such should voice your opinion in a professional way.  However, you should always choose your battles wisely–only ones that are within your sphere of influence. Doug Turnure has a great Pluralsight course about how to have a better career in software.  In it he talks about the need to avoid being a diva by always taking glamorous stands on things.  Don’t ever be that guy in a meeting where everybody rolls their eyes as you go off on soapbox after soapbox about things.  Worse yet, how would you feel if at the next meeting, you’re not invited because people think you impede progress by arguing and being confrontational on just about every issue?  You’re allowed to disagree on issues, but choose your battles wisely, and accept compromise where it makes sense, even if you don’t agree with the outcome. Every company has politics.  Do not become too immersed in it, because it almost never ends well.  Never mix politics with software development.   When we talk about battles, we’re really talking about two kinds: Questions for discussion: How can we help resolve the “customer is always right” versus the “I as the developer know what’s best for you” battle?  How do we resolve implementation battles between developers? How should we balance “rough consensus and working code” with “always doing it someone else’s way?   #3: Only strive for 2 out of 3 on the Golden Trifecta for a Model Employee The bottom line is that 2 out of 3 ain’t bad! In other words: Don’t worry about being a team player that goes against the grain. “This is how I do it, and so should you – it’s my way or the highway” attitude should prevail.  It’s better to be a liability than an asset, because adding value to a project is overrated.  There is no “I” in team! And finally, when it comes to results, you’re not about solving the problem quickly and effectively.  Take your time, since after all, you’re a two-thirds kind of a guy because at least you’re nice. But seriously.  Neil Gaiman in a famous address to the University of Arts Class of 2012 talked about what I’m calling the “Golden Trifecta for a Model Employee”, that is that you delivery high quality work, on time, and are a good team player (i.e. easy to get along with).  Almost everything you look for in a good employee boils down to these three components.  Most good employees are two out of the three.  Great employees strive for all three. Regarding being a team player, always remember that negativity breeds more negativity.  As Turnure put it, “You tend to see only what you’re looking for.  If you actively look for negative things, you’ll find them.”   Question for discussion:  What is a great way to find out if a prospective employee will meet all three demands of the trifecta?   #4: Don’t ever adapt as technology changes – stick to what you know!  You should never have to learn or relearn something.  You should never have to unlearn something.  And once you’re considered senior, you should never have to learn something new–it’s all about the comfort zone!  Be a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none.  When it comes to all technologies, it’s best to apply a litmus test (i.e. accept/reject it based off a single factor).  And above all, always be partial to or show spite for a particular language, tool, or technology. But seriously.  A senior developer once told me something that always stuck with me: “The biggest impediment to software engineers is being set in their ways.”  Often times, it’s up to you to determine how to implement a solution and what technologies to use; however, more often than not, usually a client has an established technology stack that you have to adapt to. Doug Turnure in his Pluralsight course about having a better career in software defined three things related to this that hurts people in their careers when it comes to their expertise, and they are: 1) picking a fringe technology, 2) clinging to a fading technology, and 3) holding an emotional attachment to a technology.  “The essence of marketability is to be good at what other people are using.”  Good way to know what’s in demand?  One suggestion is to look at conference topics, or see what search terms are popular on job boards.  Consulting companies are also experts at knowing what’s in demand, since they work with multiple clients in multiple industries. Avoid only liking what you use and not liking what you don’t use.  The reverse is also true. In addition, software engineers can be very opinionated people, and will fight to the death (religiously at times) for their favorite language, tool, or technology, rather than taking the time and effort to carefully weigh the advantages/disadvantages of each technology and making informed decisions. In the end, if you want a successful career in technology, you have to define a continual learning plan in order to adapt and progress, especially since technology changes so rapidly.  This includes setting SMART goals (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timeline), which may include items such as participation in code challenges, brown bags at work, certification exams, conference attendance, books, and other training resources.  Question for discussion:  How do you adapt to changing technologies, both personally and as an organization?   #5: Be as unapproachable as possible to devs [who know less than you about stuff] Patience is least important, so stop trying to explain a concept if they don’t understand it the first time.  And there’s certainly no need to be teachable.  You’re always right, because most people know less than you about stuff.  At the very least be condescending so that the developer knows that they’re not worthy of your time and expertise. But seriously.  As a software engineer, you are guaranteed to have to be a mentor at some point in your career, and the greatest software engineers are also the greatest mentors.  Although knowledge acquisition can take months or years depending on the complexity of the technology, sometimes teaching what you’ve learned to someone else can save both of you a lot of headache down the road, rather than forcing everyone to take your same learning path. It’s tempting to just want to do everything yourself, or just take over someone’s keyboard when they have a coding question.  Most often, junior developers just need a few nudges in the right direction, and then they can start to teach themselves.  Others may need a bit more hand-holding at first then others.  In general, it depends on the person, and you’ll have to take a different, more balanced approach in each situation for each person.  If someone just never seems to be progressing regardless of how many ways you try to help, then this could be a sign of deeper issues.  In general, the 30-minute rule is a good starting point, which is that if a developer is still struggling for 30 minutes or more after researching to try and find a solution to a problem, then offer to help. In a previous client, I had worked under a senior dev that had trained all of us junior devs so well to be self-sufficient that “he almost wasn’t needed anymore”.  But is this ever the case?  Do senior developers worry that by training others to do everything they do that they’re somehow progressing toward not being needed anymore?  This is a myth in the industry when it comes to job security.  The bottom line is, if you can get a team under you working well enough, your ROI will be so high that it will create a win-win situation.  You add a ton of value to the company, your burden gets lighter, and then others can recommend you without reservation for higher-stake roles in the future. And please, don’t be condescending. Nothing shatters a fragile developer more than when you belittle them or roll your eyes to others as soon as they leave, as if they aren’t even worthy of your time and expertise.   Question for discussion:  How do you best deal with other developers that are constantly asking for your help?   #6: Assume everything, especially when you think it’s common sense For most assumptions, you don’t need to get a green light from customers beforehand.  For the assumptions that do require a green light beforehand, however, just do what you think is best rather than what the customer is actually asking for, because you know better.  It’s also important to always talk before you listen. Be opinionated!  Never seek to understand the customer’s needs.  Never engage in reflective listening.  And whatever you do, forget the Platinum Rule (treating others the way they want to be treated) – it’s overrated. But seriously. This habit comes down to setting requirements that are well understood by all.  Always restate to the customer what you’re planning on in a language they can understand–getting buyoff earlier saves you a ton of heartache down the road. So many customers hate being bogged down with the technical details of a requirement, and often will tune you out when you start talking about them.  Every implementation detail doesn’t necessarily need to be discussed, but the goals of the implementation do.  Explain the strategy to the customer, not the tactics. Get your PM’s (both project and product) involved in what you’re trying to accomplish at each sprint, even if you have to by force at times.  Far too many managers use the “truck-order-delivery” mentality or some form of the waterfall approach when it comes to software deliverables, and this can lead to disastrous results.  In the blog article referenced above from shirky.com, it mentions that “…the vision of technology as something you can buy according to a plan, then have delivered as if it were coming off a truck, flatters and relieves managers who have no idea and no interest in how this stuff works….it’s also a breeding ground for disaster.”  While it’s important for the highest management levels to see the bigger picture and have more of a bird’s eye view of the product, this should never be the case for project and product managers. Almost 99% of the time, you will be given incomplete requirements, or wishy-washy ones at best. A vision is not a plan, just as a high-fidelity screenshot with lots of pretty graphics is not a website.  Form follows function.  Often times you need to be the one to gather requirements, because either the customer doesn’t know exactly what they want, they don’t want to get bogged down with the details, or they simply don’t know the right questions to ask.  Requirements should be based off a consensus between you and the customer, not one-sided.  Embrace agile, embrace change without too much scope creep, and stop testing in production!  Get feedback as early as possible in the chain. It’s also important to utilize different points of view when it comes to setting requirements.  Not only end-users, but especially BA’s (if you’re lucky enough to have one), other subject-matter experts, as well as product managers should be a part of the process.  Again–setting requirements should be a team effort.  Software engineers are creators just as much as they are builders.  Everyone needs to be involved in the decision-making process.   Question for discussion:  So many customers only want to evaluate things in a production-like environment.  How can we help to ensure early feedback in a more agile way?  How do you best establish requirements for a software project?   #7: Try to over-complicate everything, because purism is king, and you’re awesome  Prematurely optimize your code to adhere purely to every SOLID principle 100% of the time.  Take a philosophical, over-idealistic approach, and always do stuff you just read in that really great academic book from a lifetime CS professor with no practical experience (no offense to CS professors).  Never give in to balancing principle and practice. Make sure the next guy looking at your code (which will probably be you) will have to ask you for clarification on what the heck the code is supposed to be doing. This is because your code needs to make you look smart–so smart that if nobody can maintain it due to its complexity, you can smile knowing you’ve accomplished your goal.  Hooray for job security!  You’re the best now! But seriously. This all comes back to the KISS principle.  Premature optimization is the root of all evil.  In addition, I’d rather copy and paste some logic twice then having to spend hours architecting a more dynamic solution just to handle two use-cases.  Give me a third use-case for a copy-paste, and only then will I seriously consider a more dynamic solution. It’s important to remember that it’s not really about the code, it’s about the business, and understanding why you’re being paid.  You’re being paid to solve business problems, not just to write awesome code. Far too often I’ve seen grandiose ideas, plans, or visions that look great on paper, sound great in a team meeting or a lecture, but simply fail to live up to the hype in reality.  Large, enterprise-level application code bases will always have technical debt and are never perfect.  The reality is that every programmer comes to the codebase with a certain style of doing things, and with varying levels of experience.  Rough consensus and working code is important. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for SOLID principles and design patterns, but these should only be utilized where the objectives are clearly understood by all, and where it’s going to add the most value to the application.  The biggest cost factors with purism is complexity (and sometimes performance), not to mention another developer only being able to understand what’s going on in the code after a lengthy architecture presentation by a senior dev. Try to balance principle and practice.  Extremes to one end or the other are usually bad.   Question for discussion:  How do you best balance principle and practice when it comes to writing clean code?   Bringing it all together In summary, the main thing that all of these habits have in common is ego–more specifically, learning to control your ego by checking it at the door.  They also have to do with managing your own personal brand and being a balanced person.  In managing your brand, as Turnure put it, it’s important to realize that you have a user interface.  If people don’t know what you can do or how well you do it, how will they know to hire you?  How are you marketable at that point? So go out there and be passionate about your work, your brand, and above all, don’t be grumpy. Are you Left Brained or Right Brained?

URL: http://stgconsulting.com/shout-out-for-automation/
Author: Matt Chiang In the most simplistic term, automation is some type of script that controls an application to do some type of action.  However, there are flaws to this ideology.  The background to automation probably started years ago w/ someone in QA or development when they were doing the same thing over and over again.  They eventually got tired of wasting time so they wrote a script to do the same action for them automatically so they can do something else.  This probably isn’t 100% true but that is how I got started writing automation back 17 years ago.     Automation can be simple or complex.  The need for automation increases as technology advances.  Things that used to take days, weeks, months to validation will now take minutes or hours.  Machine power is cheap.  Machines never complain about doing the same thing over and over and will always be 100% focused on their task 24 hrs a day/365 days a year.  Machine power makes it cheaper to produce a product.  A look into history will reveal that just about every industry employs some type of automated process.  So why not software.  Testing software is expensive, tedious, monotonous, and error prone if you are not aware of everything that is being tested.  Automation can be built to do the same type of tests over and over and validate every possible point of failure.  Automation is also great at capturing business rules for a functionality that one would have to memorize and exercise.  Most people will end up forgetting about a business rule after a few weeks but automation won’t.     In the past, most QA engineers would only need to find some type of macro recorder, or some type of record and play back tool to get started doing automation.  This was great in the days of waterfall development where the application changes were slow to develop.  The recorded script could execute for months before a new one would need to be recorded to test a change in a function.  Nowadays, w/ every company pushing Agile development, changes are frequent and releases are fast.  Code changes daily.  Automation is needed more and more for QA engineers to keep up, especially when it comes time to do regression testing.  Most agile development sprints are 1/2/3 weeks and at the end of the sprint, the code should/needs to be releasable.  How can one test all the new features that was developed and to make sure previous code wasn’t broken because of the change w/o automation?  It’s nearly impossible.   I’ll start w/ bad automation.  In the past, code was development using procedures or basically a really long script of steps for a function to work.  The automation script would also be procedural, following a functional test script until it gets to the end.  This makes for very brittle test scripts and the QA engineer would always have to babysit his tests.  This practice does not work today in the world of object oriented development where developers uses shared libraries/classes to build a function.  This allows developers greater efficiency when building a functionality.  This also creates the need for object oriented automation.  If a QA engineer writes 100 procedural scripts that tests 100 different functional tests and one step happens to change, they would have to change it in 100 different areas.  A good example of this is a simple login.  If there are 100 tests that needs the user to be logged in and the username text field changes it’s value to User Name, then someone would have to change the script.  If the User Name field is procedural in 100 scripts, there 100 locations to change.  If the automation script was written in a object oriented pattern, then only 1 line of the script would have to be change for 100 functional tests to work again.  Good automation is built so that the code is written once and can be applied to multiple situations.  Good automation depends on data to drive the tests, not lines of automation code.  Good automation should be easy to run and can be started by anyone w/o being a QA engineer baby sitting the scripts.  Good automation can be run at anytime of the day or night and give QA, BA, PM, Management or anyone interested in test report indicating every failure or area that needs some attention.  Good automation should not fail w/ every build or simple change that would require someone to change the script w/ every time the test is run.  Good automation should be threaded so multiple tests can be run simultaneously to increase efficiency of regression testing.  Regression tests that would take one QA engineer 100 hours to run can be reduced to 10 hours or less if there are 10 tests that can be run at the same time.  The return on investment in automation would be recognized w/ only a few test runs.     Yes!  Manual testing will always be needed.  However, the time that is spent testing by manual testers are now in the areas that needs attention instead of randomly focusing on some area of the application and missing other critical areas where the code changed.  This gives QA engineers a focused testing task rather than adhoc testing task.  Automation should be looked at as a radar system for QA/Development.  The automation is only going to catch what you want to catch.  It will miss things if the engineer who wrote it missed validation points.  If it’s written correctly, a failed automated test should give the QA engineer an indication of where code was changed, so they can look at why it was changed, and what else needs to be tested.  A failed automation test is not always a bug but could lead to one.  Like the radar system, every blip on the screen is not an enemy target but could lead to one.       There are so many automation frameworks out there nowadays to help test just about everything that it would probably take a lifetime to master everyone of them along w/ new ones.  So what is missing?  The biggest piece to this automation puzzle is reporting.  Every framework will give the QA engineer a report at the end of each test run.  However, it only applies to that one time.  What if someone wants to look at historical trends?  Other than manually tracking down a test report or log, there isn’t much that is available.  However, great QA engineers will come up w/ great solutions.  Like developers building an application for customers, QA engineers builds solutions to capture test results.  A good reporting application will make great automation awesome.  It takes away the complexity from various group members in interpreting the reports or logs.  The reporting application should be accessible to anyone one the team or management.  It will give them 24/7 access to the test results and ways to query for certain tests or to look at failures.  It gives them step by step analysis of where the test failed and a screenshot of what the application looked like when it did fail.  W/ the reporting application, automation tests can run 24/7, 365 days a year.  Failed tests will need to be analyzed manually but the QA engineer does not need to babysit the tests anymore.     Just as anything in technology, the implementation has to be correct.  Poor implementation of a technology w/ only lead to frustrations, re-factoring of code, or complete re-writes.  The person doing the work needs to know what they are doing w/ the tool.  However, w/ the correct implementation of automation, applications can be released more frequently that is more stable and reliable.  The last thing anyone wants, is to have the customers test the application because QA didn’t have enough time to test it.     Author: Matt Chiang Are you Left Brained or Right Brained?

Robert Henri once said, “I am interested in art as a means of living a life; not as a means of making a living.” Fortunately for Jessica, she gets to do both. Jessica’s life has been art through music. She is an accomplished pianist, organist, and violinist. Jessica also loves orchestrating her home life; raising four children with her husband. After her children were all in school, Jessica decided to go back to school herself. While in school Jessica learned that art could be her means of making a living as well. Jessica found she had strengths in the field of development. She became particularly interested in mobile development.  Just as music is more than counting and rhythm; it involves melody and harmony – all coming together to create a musical score. With iOS and Android, it involves more than just coding; it has design, functionality, and user experience – all coming together to create a visibly appealing and functional app. Joining STG’s growing mobile team in 2012. Jessica began learning new skills, frameworks and tools; growing herself into a virtuoso in mobile as well as Java development. Jessica loves being able to keep things fresh with new projects while having a stable company to work for. Jessica is now helping to perform technical interviews for our mobile practice as well as helping clients build artistic and useful applications. Jessica’s creativity, artistry, and style help her to be a true artist in living her life and making a living.

A good QA truly lives by the motto: “leave things better than you found them.” Matt Chiang has always lived by this principle. Matt knows if you want to make something better, you must first understand the thing itself.  Understanding how something works in order to fix it and make it better started at a young age for Matt. Matt’s love of fixing things led him to learn about automobiles. Repairing, fixing and improving them has become a favorite pastime for him. When it became time to pick a career, Matt knew his passion for making things better than he found them would lend itself well to QA. After receiving his bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Matt spent several years at large corporations and small startups. He experienced extreme growth and the heartaches of downsizing. Looking for opportunities where he could share his knowledge and skills to help improve software applications, led Matt to STG in 2008.  Matt is the QA practice manager, helping to run our QA team. Matt helps to grow, train and perform technical evaluations for our employees. Matt is known to our clients as an extremely hardworking and brilliant QA. He doesn’t only understand QA, he understands software development as a whole. In order to help make applications better and to truly release software that works, one must understand the inner workings of the application. That is exactly what Matt does.  Matt is constantly working to improve his skills as well as helping those around him to grow their abilities. When Matt needs to get away, he finds himself with a fishing pole in his hand. The quite solitude of fishing helps him to rejuvenate and refresh his spirit.  Matt is dedicated to his work, fixing problems and finding solutions is his passion. Whatever Matt does he leaves it better than he found it. STG is definitely a better company because he is here.

Bryan Hansen is a champion. Whatever he decides to do, he excels at. He doesn’t excel because it’s easy, he excels because he works hard. A true champion uses any bump in the road as a stepping stone to propel them forward. That is exactly what Bryan does.  One of Bryan’s passions is competing in triathlons. There are several qualities of triathletes that make them successful. Bryan has utilized these skills to improve himself in his career and in training for triathlons.  Internal discipline give a triathlete the drive to train for success. Bryan developed internal discipline early on in his education. After almost completing a CIS degree, Bryan decided he wanted to have more than business experience, he wanted to develop. Switching majors to a CS degree took discipline and self-direction. Instead of looking at the short-term goal almost in reach of graduation, Bryan had the long-term vision of where he wanted to take his career. Following graduation, Bryan had a successful position as a programmer for an advertising agency. Bryan’s determination, consistency and focus allowed him to grow quickly. Bryan’s skill and energy drew him to a start-up company. Big dreams but poor planning led this company to failure – leaving Bryan without work.  Any triathlete knows how to deal with an obstacle, and Bryan saw this as an opportunity to grow. Bryan looked for a company with similar drive, passion, commitment, and discipline that he had. Joining STG in 2000, Bryan knew he had found a match.  Elite athletes train every day to become the best at what they do. Bryan took full advantage of the trainings and variety of projects available at STG, and became an elite programmer. Bryan’s enthusiasm for development is infectious. He mentors all those around him, whether they are candidates, clients, or employees.  Merging his business knowledge with his wealth of development expertise, Bryan rapidly moved into leadership roles at STG. Now, as the director of practice management, Bryan oversees all of our practices. He makes sure all of our employees are receiving the training, development, and mentorship that make STG great. He also helps to architect applications, solve problems, and provide direction for our clients. Because of his work ethic and skill, our clients request him by name. They know the quality of work and help they will receive when he is on a project.  Mark Allen a six time Ironman champion once said, “Until you face your fears, you don’t move to the other side, where you find the power.” That is exactly what Bryan does – Bryan moves beyond fear, disappointment and excuses. Bryan embodies the true qualities of an athlete: discipline, commitment, the ability to overcome, and the love of what you do. Giving your all and helping to lift those along the way is the sign of a true leader. That is what makes Bryan a true champion developer, mentor, director, triathlete, husband and father.  We are so glad that he is part of our team and helps us reach further, farther and faster.

URL: http://stgconsulting.com/project/davis-county-2/#menu
Davis County has been a PowerBuilder shop for many years. They began the process of trying to move over 200 applications from C# with Visual Studio.  The ramp-up time for their team was slow and they missed some urgent deadlines. Hiring some outside help was an option, but they had trepidation. Their fear was if someone came in and wrote the software and then left, leaving them little or no knowledge as to how it was written. After meeting with the team from STG, they explained our model and calmed their fears. STG recommended bringing on an expert, Dave Thresher. Dave came in and helped them immediately get some quick apps out the door. He then spent the next few months training and working side by side with their programmers getting them up to speed. Dave was able to assess the current employees’ level of understanding and helping them grow from the level they currently were at. Davis County was thrilled with Dave’s motivation and dedication to the project. If Dave saw anything that would work better or if they had a problem that they couldn’t figure out, Dave would go to work on his own and research solutions. Dave aided them in developing their own standards for programming and helping them find the correct tools to use. Davis County has utilized Dave for over a year and a half. He has migrated from being the main man and training their staff to a team programmer allowing them to put their team in charge. Davis County is now back on schedule! STG was able to help them to get them on track, train their employees to be able to maintain what was built, and help with best practices.

Background CR England is a family owned and operated business founded in 1920. They are the largest temperature-controlled carrier in the world. CR England is dedicated to providing a comprehensive range of transportation solutions to their clients. CR England is known for their quality of service as well as their emphasis on caring for their employees. Solution STG was brought on initially to help CR England with an out-of-date Java website. The old site used JSP’s and JDBC – the separation of the MVC layers was virtually non-existent. STG started by setting up a proper automated build process. STG was able to demonstrate efficient ways to write and test code before it was deployed to production. STG enabled the client to quickly come up to speed with modern Java development practices.

Background NuSkin was founded in Provo, Utah in 1984. As a premier anti-aging skin care company, NuSkin lives by its philosophy, “all of the good, none of the bad.” The company markets its products in 53 international markets through a network of over 950,000 independent distributors. In 2010, NuSkin was listed among Forbes “100 Most Trustworthy Companies.” As the company moves forward into the future, they are dedicated to producing innovation, integrity, and setting the standard in their industry. Solution STG has recently helped NuSkin in two major areas: Mobile development and QA. STG consultants worked closely with the NuSkin developers to build a point of sale application that interfaces with a hand held device. Most recently, STG has been working on improving NuSkin’s mobile code base, bringing it current and in line with iOS and Android standards. STG consultants also developed libraries and modules that can be used in future apps to speed up development and standardize certain types of functionality. Our QA specialists built an automation framework from the ground up using Webdriver, Java, TestNG, and Maven to test shopping and monthly auto shopping for all 54 markets. Automation also includes verification of shopping and all the pages for 12 microsites along with the corporate website. STG helped to build an automation reporting web app using Ruby on Rails that facilitates automated testing with logging of all test results. Our team built an automation that tests ten web services; reducing the manual effort of product verification from six people taking roughly half an hour to complete – to three people less than ten minutes. STG’s senior QA helped to teach the NuSkin QA group Java development as well as Webdriver automation so they could continue to write automation that would be effective and efficient for the company.     


URL: http://stgconsulting.com/project/deer-valley/#menu
Background In 2011 Deer Valley Resort Management recognized the need for a full web site redesign. The inhouse web development team didn’t have the knowledge and skills to handle this demanding project on their own. STG was approached to work with Deer Valley to both rebuild the site and provide training and mentoring for the internal web development team. The Marketing team, an outside design agency, the internal development team worked together with a Senior Architect from STG to plan and implement the new website architecture and design using the Microsoft .net framework. The ski industry has many service providers who’ve developed solutions that work for a standard resort. But Deer Valley has unique customers with specific needs. An out of the box solutions was not capable of delivering the functionality and user experience that Deer Valley required. Solution The goals and timeline for completing the new website were ambitious and required working with a number of stakeholders within the company. The Lead Architect from STG managed the project from end-to-end while training and mentoring the in-house web development team. The new design has been tremendously successful. Revenue from the website has increased year over year. Guests can now access all retail aspects of the resort website through a single user profile. And the number of phone calls to the lodging reservation center have dropped significantly due to the easy to use rental property. View Site

Background Worker’s Compensation Fund’s mission is to provide exceptional workers compensation insurance services to their policyholders, business partners, workers, and the others they serve.

After our initial training, STG has now been involved in helping to fix existing applications to stabilize production issues, migrating old data from LDAP and DB2 to a new security model, and upgrading security model to use CAS and implementing single sign on across new and existing applications. STG developed and coauthored an application augmented with WCF staff to help with the technology handoff. Establishing a new development stack with current best practices, and mentoring WCF staff on the new stack enabled WCF to maintain and continue on with the same development practices that were implemented.

It takes someone with many talents and interests to successfully direct the operations of a dynamic company like STG. Fortunately, we have the perfect person in Michele Stone. In 1987, after stints as a massage therapist and a certified nurse assistant, which bolstered her passion for helping people, she got into the software game at WordPerfect. In 2002, Michele, along with her husband and her brother, launched her own IT consulting and staffing firm, which quickly grew into a global IT services company. In 2014, not long after selling her company, Michele came to work for STG. Her background in software makes her extremely knowledgeable about the technical aspects of the industry, but Michele is also passionate about the people behind the systems and has built a strong sense of community among her team. She is currently working on a degree in psychology from the University of Utah, which will further her understanding of people and how to best utilize their strengths. Michele believes that a commitment to work/life balance leads to better productiveness at work and greater satisfaction in life. She takes advantage of her time away from the office by spending it with her husband and four children—up on the slopes at Alta or enjoying a vacation at some far-flung location.

His tireless energy propels him forward at all times. In his past jobs at consulting firms and global corporate organizations, Greg has been involved in helping to place thousands of professionals in successful and rewarding positions. He received BA degrees in both psychology and business management from Luther College in Iowa, so he has a great knowledge of both people and procedures, making him a particularly adept leader. Since joining STG in December of 2014, Greg has kept things hopping, finding immense satisfaction in watching people grow, develop, and flourish in their careers—people who would probably like to thank him for the role he has played in their success, if only they could get him to stand still for a moment.

Author: Shanaz Lavasanie  I’ve heard a lot of personality-related labels: introverted, optimistic, strong but silent, drama queen, etc. But left-brain or right-brain? These labels may not be well-known.    Whether it is our left hemisphere that is more dominant or our right one, the distinction can impact our personality and the decisions we make. Each hemisphere of the brain is dominant for different behaviors. If you would split the brain right down the middle into two symmetrical or equal parts, you would have a right and left hemisphere. Although equal in size, these two sides are not the same, and do not carry out the same functions.  The left side of the brain is responsible for controlling the right side of the body. It also performs tasks that have to do with logic, such as in science and mathematics.  On the other hand, the right hemisphere coordinates the left side of the body, and performs tasks that have do with creativity and the arts.  Both hemispheres are connected by the corpus callosum and serve the body in different ways. There are a lot of quizzes and you can test yourself to see which one you are.   Here is a link to just one of them: http://www.web-us.com/brain/braindominance.htm   Now a bit about me. I love math. My major in high school was Physics and Mathematics Science. In college I studied computer science. I am able to speak three languages, Persian, Japanese and English. I am right handed. So I should be a left-brained. Right? We human are such amazing creatures. We still don’t know so much about our brain. I’ve heard it said that we use less than 10% of our brain’s capacity. Have you ever felt that you have an urge to do something for yourself but you don’t know what it is. Have you ever felt that urge drive you crazy sometimes? I am not talking about the urge to have a big cheese hamburger (which, truth be told, does drive me crazy sometimes.) When we feel these urges, some of us may know what it is and we go for it, some of us may need a trigger to take us there. I was the latter one. I tried to find my hidden urge by doing writing, painting on canvas or paper, or learning music. I still felt there must be something else inside me that must be hiding. It was May 21 2015, I came back home from work with a lot of anger, and frustrated feelings. I tried to watch TV, to distract myself, it didn’t work. I tried to eat junk food to distract myself, and it didn’t work either. I couldn’t stop to switch off my brain not to think what had happened at work. Like a zombie I sat behind my computer and opened the MS Paint app. I grabbed the mouse and moved it fiercely around and around. I saw the cursor on my screen moving in every direction, creating lines without any clear shapes. I grabbed that black mouse like I was sitting on the back of a black dragon that was going to take me anywhere, everywhere. That dragon took me to the top of rainbow arch, to the bottom of ocean, among the flowers or on the silver moon. I felt I could touch everything that I wanted to. I could kiss the moon and kick the rainbow arch to see how those beautiful colors like soft powders were pouring on my screen. I could even feel the breeze of air through my hair. Inside of me I was screaming and laughing loudly like a child; I was happy and felt free. My black dragon came and rescued me from darkness. I painted and painted and painted, I didn’t know for how many hours. My eyelids were heavier and the pain in my wrist from moving the mouse around and around pushed me to look at the clock on the corner of my screen. It said 2:00 in the morning! Every part of my body was tired, but my brain didn’t want to stop; my brain still wanted to dance and sing with that dragon. The cursor was moving faster than ever, lines showing clear shapes more than ever. This morphine of painting was in my blood and giving me so much pleasure that I didn’t even care about time or my pain and my exhausted body. My brain now was telling me about my hidden urge. Yes that’s it, I had found it. In two months I painted almost 80 pictures and showed them to everyone that I knew, from families to friends. I’ve come to realize that painting gives me a lot of pleasure and joy that I wish I could explain it to you.   Given all of what I’ve shared, you may have wondered what the result of the brain test was for me.: It said that I am both; left and right brained. As developers or designers we may be stereotyped into one class or another. In my opinion, I don’t believe people are Left OR Right brained. I believe all of us are both left AND right brained and we should explore both sides to find what makes us happy. What do you think?

Author: Chris Lake   One of the ways that STG likes to partner with its clients is to sit in as an observer when we have a candidate interview.  We don’t interfere with anything said, but being in the room helps us observe and see both how the candidate does and what needs our client has that perhaps we had not thought to consider in our candidate search.  It really is a great opportunity. One of the results of sitting in so many interviews is that I get to see many different interview styles and situations.  I’ve seen some candidates just rock the interview and I’ve seen others blow it so badly that it’s almost physically painful to sit and watch them struggle.   Although we never share specific interview questions from clients, I’ve noticed a few specific suggestions and ideas that I think every person going through a technical interview should be aware of.  PAY ATTENTION to the items below—they may just land you that dream job!  There’s no way I could cover everything in a quick blog, but here are just a couple of the big ones. It’s often said that you never get a second chance to make a first impression.  I’ve heard that it takes typically less than 7 seconds for that first impression to be formed.  A lot can go into making those 7 seconds count:   Often in a technical interview, they will ask you to go up to a white board and write out a solution to a technical problem.  Even if you’ve seen this other people do this a hundred times, when it’s you standing up, it’s almost guaranteed that the pressure of the moment will cause a strange effect of having your intelligence shut off as soon as your knees lock and you lift the marker to write.  It happens to the best of them (and that includes you!)  Here’s a couple tips to keep in mind:   At the end of almost every interview, you will be asked “So, what questions do you have for us?”  Before the interview, you should make a list of questions that you’d like to ask that don’t make you sound like an idiot or someone who doesn’t care enough to ask a real question.  Here are some common good topics:   HOWEVER, the most important question you NEED TO ASK is some variation of the following: This question is of utmost importance because if the interviewers have any concerns regarding your experience and you cannot overcome their concerns, you probably will not have a chance of landing this job or being asked back for a second interview. This is a great question and has often turned a negative interview into a positive one—Sell yourself.  It’s amazing how you can clear up misperceptions that otherwise would have sunk you as a candidate.     Once the interview is over, make sure you thank them for their time, shake their hands like you mean it and walk away like a professional.  You will have just been through an experience together and you may feel an urge to confess some deeply personal thing to your new found buddy as you walk out together.  Please don’t.  Unless they ask about it, now is not the time to start sharing about your personal life and what crazy plans you have for the weekend.  You’ve aced the interview.  Don’t leave them with a question mark in their minds. Make sure you follow up within 24 hours with a quick note (email is fine) thanking them for the opportunity and reiterating why you feel you are a great fit for the spot.  Since you already have their card from the beginning of the interview, it should just take a few minutes of your time.  This one thing can help set you apart from the pile of others they talk to and help you be remembered. There is nothing here that is rocket science and nothing you’ve probably not heard before.  However, hopefully these few tips will help you turn your next interview into your next position!     Author: Chris Lake   Are you Left Brained or Right Brained?

Author: Geoffrey Sagers   I recently had the opportunity to attend the RootsTech Genealogy conference held in Salt Lake City, Utah. One of the sessions I attended was the Innovator Showdown. It was the final six of numerous of entries to “show off” how technology can improve family history — the world’s largest org chart. Most people think of family history as old books in dusty libraries, cemeteries, huge stacks of papers, and the county clerk’s office. However, the finalists included medical history tracking, hardware-software combination using iPhone technology, data visualization, and digital record-keeping. Each finalist shared the technology they used for their platform and some common threads emerged. TapGenes uses software to map likelihood of certain genetic traits that could affect other family members such as cancers, chromosomal diseases and heart/stroke risks. This information can then be used by families to create a specific roadmap for testing when they go in for general physicals and diseases could be caught much sooner.

Author: Geoffrey Sagers   I recently had the opportunity to attend the RootsTech Genealogy conference held in Salt Lake City, Utah. One of the sessions I attended was the Innovator Showdown. It was the final six of numerous of entries to “show off” how technology can improve family history — the world’s largest org chart. Most people think of family history as old books in dusty libraries, cemeteries, huge stacks of papers, and the county clerk’s office. However, the finalists included medical history tracking, hardware-software combination using iPhone technology, data visualization, and digital record-keeping. Each finalist shared the technology they used for their platform and some common threads emerged. TapGenes uses software to map likelihood of certain genetic traits that could affect other family members such as cancers, chromosomal diseases and heart/stroke risks. This information can then be used by families to create a specific roadmap for testing when they go in for general physicals and diseases could be caught much sooner.

Author: Patricia Johnson Like me, you probably expect that html code is going to display virtually the same in every browser, with a few known exceptions. There are small foibles in rendering between the assorted web browsers, but with every update, those differences become fewer and fewer, and the CSS “hacks” for these issues are well-known and widely used. Until the first time you’re assigned to program an HTML email. Oh, it looks easy enough, and often it doesn’t even have to be responsive, so you quickly code the email, checking in all the browsers for inconsistencies, and then send it off the test email. And then it explodes in your face. What was beautiful HTML code in your web browser has arrived in your inbox looking like something straight out of Geocities, circa 1996. What happened?!   Email clients seem to have a free pass on W3C standards compliance and implementation To some degree, every existing email client has varying, but never complete, W3C standards compliance in their html rendering engine. Some are pretty close (Apple and iOS) and some seem to be thumbing their nose at the W3C and making rude hand gestures at developers everywhere (Outlook 2011 uses IE as its html rendering engine, but every other version, including 2016, uses MS Word). Because of this, developers often flail about virtually, and sometimes actually, when coding their first emails. None of the things you can take for granted when coding a webpage seem to be true, when it comes to programming for email. And since there’s no way of knowing until after the fact which email client your recipient is using, you have to code your email for the least common denominator. Just pretend it’s 1999, and you should be fine.   First off, you can stop making that face. There’s no getting around it. I know, if your web portfolio was written like this, you could expect not just to not get the job, but to perhaps be laughed out of the interviewer’s office, and maybe even hear some four-letter words for having wasted their time, on the way out. But this isn’t a webpage, it’s an email, so just grit your teeth and bear it.   Say goodbye to stylesheets Due to potential security issues, emails will not allow you to reference an external stylesheet, no matter where you host it. And because Gmail does not support <style> tags, in either the head or body of an email, every bit of CSS you write for the desktop view must be an inline style. Fortunately, there are several free tools available online to help with your inline style needs. Campaign Monitor’s CSS Inliner  or Zurb’s Ink allow you to write a <style> tag in the head of your html document – when the time comes to deliver the email, you will copy and paste your code into their tool, which will then add the CSS not found inside media queries (more on responsive emails in a later post) to your html code as inline styles. Just a tip – I would save the version for delivery out as a separate file. It makes it a lot easier to tweak your code, should you find any bugs (and you will) after that first test send.   Say Hello to Deprecated, Ugly, Tangled Code While you can use modern HTML and CSS for much of your email, there are a few common elements you won’t want to use, either because it will make adding responsive code easier later if you don’t, or because it simply is not supported in one or more of the major email clients. The first major difference is that divs won’t work for layout anymore. You must go back to using tables to create your grid. Don’t forget to add “cellspacing=’0’ cellpadding=’0’” to every <table> declaration, or Outlook and its incarnations (Hotmail, Outlook.com) are going to add a seemingly random amount of padding and space to your table elements, throwing your design off in a rather spectacular manner. You also want to declare your dimensions in the “td” tags, but not with css – use “width=x” and “height=x”, without “px” after the number. This both prevents box-model issues and makes it much easier to change the dimensions in your media queries, should you use them later. And speaking of Outlook, it doesn’t recognize the “padding” property for p, div and a tags, so you’re going to have to use nested tables with padding added to the <td> tags for your white space needs. To make this an even bigger slap in the face, Outlook.com doesn’t support “margin” at all, so it’s more nested tables to the rescue. Outlook also doesn’t recognize images as block level elements by default,  so every <img> must have “display: block” in its style tag, as well as “border=’0’” in its attributes if it’s part of a link, in order to get them to sit where you want them, and not have big blue borders. “Float” is no longer an option, which is why you need tables for columns. If you need something to move to the left or right of something – for example, an image, placed to the right of a paragraph- you’ll need to use “align=’right’” in the image tag. JavaScript is universally stripped from emails at the receiving end, in order to prevent virus transmission, and for the same reason, background images are also inaccessible. So if your designer provides you with a lovely photograph with copy on top, the whole thing will have to be cut as an image, text and all. This is alright for a header banner, but occasionally you get a client who wants to be able to edit their headers (if you’re programming a branded template, for example), so you’ll have to send the design back to the drawing board, so to speak. “Live text”, as it were, needs a solid colored background behind it – usually that’s white, but any other solid color that may be specified with CSS can also be used. Thanks to Outlook (again), you will have to re-declare your font statements – font-family, color, font-size, line-height – every time you add another nested table – it will not inherit past a “table” tag. If you are using one of the inlining tools I linked to previously, you may want to add those declarations to the td, p and a elements, to be sure they are always correct. Otherwise Outlook will pretend you’ve never mentioned font styles, and will serve up times new roman, in black, at the default font-size for the recipients’ version of the client. Additionally, you need to declare font-size and color in every <h> element, now that Outlook.com wants to apply its own formatting to headlines. If you don’t want your h1 tags to be green (I’m not exaggerating – Outlook.com makes all h1 tags green by default), you need to specify what color they should be, even if the color is already declared elsewhere (for example, in the surrounding td tag).   Email Best Practices Your email should be roughly 600px wide at its maximum resolution, responsive or not. This prevents side-scrolling in most desktop email clients, and also prevents too much white-space around the email in the reading pane. Do use white space appropriately. Huge blocks of text are hard to read – remember to break up paragraphs with a little spacing in between, and have some padding between columns, if you used them. Do use a web-safe font – you can’t call to a font server in an email, just like you can’t call out to an external style sheet. Georgia and Verdana are easy on the eyes, with Arial and Helvetica a close second. Always add a fallback to your font-family declarations – “Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif” will make sure no one accidentally gets Times New Roman, even if they don’t have Verdana, Arial or Helvetica. It will save the readers’ eyes, and your design aesthetics. The only exception to the above rule is if you’re programming an email intended solely for internal corporate use, and the font in question is their corporate brand font – it’s safe to assume that everyone in the company will have that font installed on their work computer. Still provide the fallback fonts, because more than half those people are likely to open that email on a personal mobile device, which may not be able to access that font, at one time or another.   Keep font sizes at 12px or larger if at all possible. Not only are smaller fonts hard to read on a mobile device, but the Apple email clients will “fix that” for you by blowing up tiny fonts to a larger, more mobile-friendly size – but will not adjust the line-height, so your text may be squished or even have overlapping lines. Optimize your images for file size, and if you’re the designer, try to use no more than 6 per email. Images increase load time on emails, and studies have shown that even increasing load time by a few seconds can dramatically increase the rate of deleting said email before it ever opens, especially on mobile devices. Gmail and some of the other email clients count the number of images in your email, and may flag your email as potential spam if it has more than half a dozen images. Always supply alt tags for your images, for use by screen readers, and hard code the dimensions using the width and height attributes of the img tag, so your layout isn’t askew if the email loads with images disabled by default. Those descriptive alt tags will help get your message across as you intended it, even if the viewer never downloads the images. Tinypng.org offers a free, web-based png and jpeg compression tool that can cut your file sizes by an average of 30 – 75% or more, with no visible loss of quality.   And lastly… Remember that unless you’re creating an OFT (Outlook Format Template) or EML file only as the deliverable, your images are not embedded in your file, and the images must be hosted online somewhere, with absolute paths in the html to reference them. Email testing services like Email On Acid or Litmus will save you time and prevent frustration-induced baldness. These services allow you to send a test email to a single email address, upload a zipped file with your html and images, or copy and paste your html code (or all 3), and then shows you a screenshot of how your email looks on arrival in almost every email client conceivable. This is especially valuable if you’re programming responsive emails, but it is always good to see how your email holds up on Apple Mail vs an Android phone vs Gmail in Chrome vs Outlook 2011, whether it is responsive or not. You can quickly check and recheck for any client specific errors in your email with these services, so that the email files you deliver are bulletproof, whatever their format – without having to own an extensive testing lab of computers. There are numerous quality resources online for learning more about the pitfalls of programming emails. The blogs at Campaign Monitor, EmailOnAcid, Litmus, and Mail Chimp are full of extremely helpful information when it comes to troubleshooting your particular email issue.     Author: Patricia Johnson Are you Left Brained or Right Brained?

This is especially valuable if you’re programming responsive emails, but it is always good to see how your email holds up on Apple Mail vs an Android phone vs Gmail in Chrome vs Outlook 2011, whether it is responsive or not. You can quickly check and recheck for any client specific errors in your email with these services, so that the email files you deliver are bulletproof, whatever their format – without having to own an extensive testing lab of computers. There are numerous quality resources online for learning more about the pitfalls of programming emails. The blogs at Campaign Monitor, EmailOnAcid, Litmus, and Mail Chimp are full of extremely helpful information when it comes to troubleshooting your particular email issue.     Author: Patricia Johnson Are you Left Brained or Right Brained?

Author: Neal Jenks Design Consultant | IxD Practice Manager   Ah, end-of-year: The time when a young man/woman’s fancy turns to lists. I asked Software Technology Group’s illustrious IxD Practice members to share some of their favorite UX/UI discoveries from the past year. What followed was an entertaining and instructive mixed-bag of websites, apps, and more. Enjoy!   InVision  invisionapp.com The free prototyping tool that UX designers love just keeps getting better and better. InVision has now extended well beyond hot-linking comps to terrific animations and transitions, cross-platform support, project management, development hand-off tools and more. And dang are those features easy to use. I consider InVision to be one of the best web-based apps of all time.   Typeform typeform.com Boring forms move aside. Here’s a form generator with a simple, robust interface that creates gorgeous, user-friendly forms. Survey Monkey, you have been shamed.   Snowbird snowbird.com Okay, so it’s not responsive yet, but the website for Snowbird Ski Resort demonstrates the power of branding, design consistency, and beautiful, purposeful animation. To see what I mean, check out the great snow report side-bar animation. I love me some accordion-fold action.   Google Play – Music play.google.com/music Google Material Design standards are slowly taking over the look, feel, and functionality of the Internet, and their music player shows why. Bold, purposeful and fun, this app makes finding music intuitive, user-centered, and insanely easy. Watch your back iTunes.   Wikiwand wikiwand.com The world’s most popular Wikipedia reader has so much respect for the content and the user, it’s disgusting. Wikiwand shows us that, when the interface takes the back seat in the experience, it’s a sign of elegance, not acquiescence.    Epicurrence.com epicurrence.com For those with a strong aversion to design for design’s sake, avert your eyes. For the rest of you, behold and rejoice. The multiple scroll rates tied to each graphic, the beautiful typography, the limited palette—all of these come together to form a single, cohesive piece that entices one to flick the ol’ scroll wheel again and again.   Domo.com domo.com This has to be one of my favorite corporate websites. Do yourself a favor: Click and drag the bottom-right corner of your browser window to see a responsive/adaptive design done right. Each break point, each grid, each resized image speaks of craftsmanship and attention to detail. This is screen optimization at its highest.  Wire wire.com In the world awash in messaging applications, some absolute gems have been overlooked. Such is, unfortunately, the case with Wire. Here at last is a gorgeous messaging app that just works right: HD voice quality, quick image uploads, and a lot more. The layouts, the huge graphics, the customization—all bespeak refinement and appreciation for the user. Now if only Wire could find some users to return the favor.   Oakley Airbrake MX moto.oakley.com The site loads horrifically slow, but to the patient, the spoils. Behold the full power of parallax scrolling: Not just for wow-factor, but for a ponderously perfect product demo. Here is a site not content to merely blow your mind and let it be. Oakley has put together a masterpiece of marketing. Prepare to pine for impact-resistant goggles.   Inception Explained inception-explained.com It’s a cool visual representation of a cool movie.

Author: Neal Jenks   Allow me to wax prophetic. A vibrant, waning year tends to open our imaginations to the unexplored horizons yet to come, and this is especially true of the IxD world.  If the past year has taught us anything, it is that we have absolutely no clue what to expect. But heck… that just makes conjecture more fun. So…come along as I attempt to follow our current, cryptic trajectories into an unknown and exciting future. Let the wild speculations commence!   Sketch vs. Illustrator Wars Mark my words: Adobe Illustrator has a new Bohemian contender. In 2016, Sketch is ready to put down a beating on the World Heavyweight Vector-Graphics Champion. Why? First and foremost, it’s cheaper. A $99 flat fee vs. $49 per month for Creative Cloud is hard to ignore. And it’s ALMOST as powerful as Illustrator. I’m still learning about Sketch, but the Art Board controls are much slicker and plug-ins, like the content generator, kick some serious butt. Best of all is Sketch’s seamless integration with other applications. InVision offers real-time syncing with Sketch files. Make an update in Sketch, and your Invision prototypes reflect those updates instantly. Zeplin works beautifully with Sketch files as well. Forget spending countless hours creating UI pattern libraries and communicating with developers about your work. Upload your Sketch files to Zeplin, and you’re pretty much done. The only area where Sketch seems to be a little behind is in pure vector editing. That being said, keep your eye on Sketch. It floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee.   One Material Design to Rule Them All Watch your back, Mac. Material Design is poised to take over the world this year. When creating a native iOS or Android app, it’s important to be an upstanding citizen in that space. In other words, if you’re creating an iOS app, it should look like an iOS app. To help IxDs model good citizenship, Apple has provided Human Interface Guidelines. For Google/Android, there’s Material Design. Material Design standards attempt to define all Google’s branding across all of its properties, from layout and typography to UI patterns and components. In the process, they’ve created a style guide that is simple, intentional, easy to apply across various products, and, in their own words, “delightful.” In my estimation, they’ve largely succeeded. As Material Design continues its meteoric rise, Human Interface seems to be floundering. Always considered a bastion of hope and adoration by designers worldwide, now Apple design standards are under active attack. No longer a sacred cow, Bruce Tognazzini and Don Norman recently tore Apple a new one, accusing them of losing their way, designing for design’s sake, and focusing inwardly rather than on users. In today’s user-focused digital space, Material Design just makes more sense, and I predict that it will slowly envelop our design consciousness to the exclusion of all else.   Lean UX Getting Leaner Clients and companies all want to create more from less, and for some reason, UX always stands out as a target for attrition. So UX will get leaner this year. The question is: In what way? I attended a Lean UX workshop, and I was shocked to learn that “lean” to the presenter definitely wasn’t lean to me. For example, he kept his UX cost down by doing fewer focus groups with fewer people when testing. On my team, we go even leaner, sending out surveys periodically in order to inform our decisions on a feature, or conducting very small focus groups ONLY WHEN there’s significant question about an interaction. We also rely heavily on our application’s User Feedback section. He also focused on creating much lower fidelity prototypes for stakeholders — using what looked like InVision. Once again, my team takes lean prototyping even further. I generally tell an interactive “story” with a series of non-interactive comps viewed in order. So who of us struck the appropriate balance between and efficiency and efficacy? Who knows. I predict that, in 2016, we’ll spend a lot more time answering questions like this.   The Great Rapid Prototyping Conflict of our Time When technology is new and demand is high, multiple solution providers always vie for top-honors. When it comes to prototyping tech, our clear-cut front runner remains undecided. This year, a leader may finally emerge. InVision is certainly one of, if not the most, commonly used prototyping application today. However, common usage hardly denotes a front-runner. Despite awesome features like improved animations and transitions, cross-platform support, real-time collaboration, etc., designers still pine for more robust offerings. Axure Pro provides more robust features than InVision, but at $589 per license, many clients still deem free InVision “good enough.” Several impressive image-to-code tools are also waiting their turn in the limelight: Macaw and Pixate in particular. And for those in love with code, don’t forget the power of customization inherent in front-end frameworks like Bootstrap. Who will emerge triumphant from the maelstorm? Maybe 2016 will decide.   There you have it: A few predictions for our ephemeral IxD world. What do you think? Did I hit the nail on the prognosticative head? Or is there a whole lotta “NO” in my Nostradamus? Email neal.jenks@stgconsulting.com, and let me know!   Author: Neal Jenks Are you Left Brained or Right Brained?

URL: http://stgconsulting.com/7-habits-of-highly-ineffective-software-engineers/#menu
By Quinn Heiner   In this article (which has no relation to Covey’s famous book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, except maybe the number seven), we will take a different approach in our discussion of good habits by first pointing out the bad ones.  By going from ineffective to effective, we will essentially discover what really separates good engineers from the exceptional.   #1: Don’t ever try to re-balance the time-scope-quality triangle.   If you do, be sure to never articulate this tradeoff to the customer.  More importantly, be sure to ignore  Murphy’s three laws: 1) everything takes longer than you think, 2) nothing is as easy as it looks, and 3) if something can go wrong, it will.  By doing this, you’ll ensure that a product will be delivered late, have way too many features than originally agreed upon, and be full of bugs (not to mention way over budget).  In addition, the customer (who fortunately has a great sense of humor) will have a good laugh and you’ll both be on your merry way to the next project. But seriously.  Although this triangle sometimes autocorrects by force, far too many engineers think that this triangle is the PM’s problem (project or product manager).  Honestly, it should be both your problems.  You as a developer are closer to the product’s internals than anyone else, and it is your responsibility to regularly communicate the current state of the triangle to your managers and recommend re-balancing strategies. Certainly, the biggest problem with analyzing this triangle is that managers tend to use the wrong data to assess progress.  That is, they only use timeline and budget as their indicators of progress, when they ought to be incorporating user stories and user acceptance tests as a better indicator.  To summarize, people in charge tend to view the time-scope-quality triangle as more of a time-scope-resources triangle, when resources != quality.  In reality, not all resources are created equal, and so often times it’s four variables you should take into account, not three: A great article on a shirky.com web blog talked about why healthcare.gov failed and applied it to I.T. projects in general.  A quote from it that I really liked, “If I had to design a litmus test…[for managing I.T. projects, and we’ll talk about litmus tests more in habit 4]…I would look for just one signal: Can anyone with authority over a new project articulate the tradeoff between features, quality, and time?” “When a project cannot meet all three goals—a situation Healthcare.gov was clearly in—something will give. If you want certain features at a certain level of quality, you’d better be able to move the deadline. If you want overall quality by a certain deadline, you’d better be able to simplify, delay, or drop features. And if you have a fixed feature list and deadline, quality will suffer.” The most common scenario in my experience is scope creep with decreasing time–therefore quality has to suffer, or you have to suffer putting in crazy hours to meet a deadline.  It doesn’t have to be this way. Sometimes we have to learn to say “no” even if something is feasible, even reasonable.  Other times, we have to stretch ourselves and say “yes” even if we know it may take some effort.   Question for discussion: What are some strategies or tactics you’ve employed to keep this triangle balanced and happy?   #2: Only choose battles you will lose. Time isn’t precious, and so if you know you’re going up against “the man”, or a brick wall of politics, or stubborn customers, keep fighting until you finally lose.  Always try to be the martyr, because nothing feels better than telling someone “I told you so!  I warned you about this!” afterward.  Speaking of battles…why even start one?  Just code a bunch of stuff that affects a bunch of other stuff and do not tell anyone. But seriously.  Don’t get me wrong on this, you are a consultant and should be actively involved in the decision-making process, and as such should voice your opinion in a professional way.  However, you should always choose your battles wisely–only ones that are within your sphere of influence. Doug Turnure has a great Pluralsight course about how to have a better career in software.  In it he talks about the need to avoid being a diva by always taking glamorous stands on things.  Don’t ever be that guy in a meeting where everybody rolls their eyes as you go off on soapbox after soapbox about things.  Worse yet, how would you feel if at the next meeting, you’re not invited because people think you impede progress by arguing and being confrontational on just about every issue?  You’re allowed to disagree on issues, but choose your battles wisely, and accept compromise where it makes sense, even if you don’t agree with the outcome. Every company has politics.  Do not become too immersed in it, because it almost never ends well.  Never mix politics with software development.   When we talk about battles, we’re really talking about two kinds: Questions for discussion: How can we help resolve the “customer is always right” versus the “I as the developer know what’s best for you” battle?  How do we resolve implementation battles between developers? How should we balance “rough consensus and working code” with “always doing it someone else’s way?   #3: Only strive for 2 out of 3 on the Golden Trifecta for a Model Employee The bottom line is that 2 out of 3 ain’t bad! In other words: Don’t worry about being a team player that goes against the grain. “This is how I do it, and so should you – it’s my way or the highway” attitude should prevail.  It’s better to be a liability than an asset, because adding value to a project is overrated.  There is no “I” in team! And finally, when it comes to results, you’re not about solving the problem quickly and effectively.  Take your time, since after all, you’re a two-thirds kind of a guy because at least you’re nice. But seriously.  Neil Gaiman in a famous address to the University of Arts Class of 2012 talked about what I’m calling the “Golden Trifecta for a Model Employee”, that is that you delivery high quality work, on time, and are a good team player (i.e. easy to get along with).  Almost everything you look for in a good employee boils down to these three components.  Most good employees are two out of the three.  Great employees strive for all three. Regarding being a team player, always remember that negativity breeds more negativity.  As Turnure put it, “You tend to see only what you’re looking for.  If you actively look for negative things, you’ll find them.”   Question for discussion:  What is a great way to find out if a prospective employee will meet all three demands of the trifecta?   #4: Don’t ever adapt as technology changes – stick to what you know!  You should never have to learn or relearn something.  You should never have to unlearn something.  And once you’re considered senior, you should never have to learn something new–it’s all about the comfort zone!  Be a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none.  When it comes to all technologies, it’s best to apply a litmus test (i.e. accept/reject it based off a single factor).  And above all, always be partial to or show spite for a particular language, tool, or technology. But seriously.  A senior developer once told me something that always stuck with me: “The biggest impediment to software engineers is being set in their ways.”  Often times, it’s up to you to determine how to implement a solution and what technologies to use; however, more often than not, usually a client has an established technology stack that you have to adapt to. Doug Turnure in his Pluralsight course about having a better career in software defined three things related to this that hurts people in their careers when it comes to their expertise, and they are: 1) picking a fringe technology, 2) clinging to a fading technology, and 3) holding an emotional attachment to a technology.  “The essence of marketability is to be good at what other people are using.”  Good way to know what’s in demand?  One suggestion is to look at conference topics, or see what search terms are popular on job boards.  Consulting companies are also experts at knowing what’s in demand, since they work with multiple clients in multiple industries. Avoid only liking what you use and not liking what you don’t use.  The reverse is also true. In addition, software engineers can be very opinionated people, and will fight to the death (religiously at times) for their favorite language, tool, or technology, rather than taking the time and effort to carefully weigh the advantages/disadvantages of each technology and making informed decisions. In the end, if you want a successful career in technology, you have to define a continual learning plan in order to adapt and progress, especially since technology changes so rapidly.  This includes setting SMART goals (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timeline), which may include items such as participation in code challenges, brown bags at work, certification exams, conference attendance, books, and other training resources.  Question for discussion:  How do you adapt to changing technologies, both personally and as an organization?   #5: Be as unapproachable as possible to devs [who know less than you about stuff] Patience is least important, so stop trying to explain a concept if they don’t understand it the first time.  And there’s certainly no need to be teachable.  You’re always right, because most people know less than you about stuff.  At the very least be condescending so that the developer knows that they’re not worthy of your time and expertise. But seriously.  As a software engineer, you are guaranteed to have to be a mentor at some point in your career, and the greatest software engineers are also the greatest mentors.  Although knowledge acquisition can take months or years depending on the complexity of the technology, sometimes teaching what you’ve learned to someone else can save both of you a lot of headache down the road, rather than forcing everyone to take your same learning path. It’s tempting to just want to do everything yourself, or just take over someone’s keyboard when they have a coding question.  Most often, junior developers just need a few nudges in the right direction, and then they can start to teach themselves.  Others may need a bit more hand-holding at first then others.  In general, it depends on the person, and you’ll have to take a different, more balanced approach in each situation for each person.  If someone just never seems to be progressing regardless of how many ways you try to help, then this could be a sign of deeper issues.  In general, the 30-minute rule is a good starting point, which is that if a developer is still struggling for 30 minutes or more after researching to try and find a solution to a problem, then offer to help. In a previous client, I had worked under a senior dev that had trained all of us junior devs so well to be self-sufficient that “he almost wasn’t needed anymore”.  But is this ever the case?  Do senior developers worry that by training others to do everything they do that they’re somehow progressing toward not being needed anymore?  This is a myth in the industry when it comes to job security.  The bottom line is, if you can get a team under you working well enough, your ROI will be so high that it will create a win-win situation.  You add a ton of value to the company, your burden gets lighter, and then others can recommend you without reservation for higher-stake roles in the future. And please, don’t be condescending. Nothing shatters a fragile developer more than when you belittle them or roll your eyes to others as soon as they leave, as if they aren’t even worthy of your time and expertise.   Question for discussion:  How do you best deal with other developers that are constantly asking for your help?   #6: Assume everything, especially when you think it’s common sense For most assumptions, you don’t need to get a green light from customers beforehand.  For the assumptions that do require a green light beforehand, however, just do what you think is best rather than what the customer is actually asking for, because you know better.  It’s also important to always talk before you listen. Be opinionated!  Never seek to understand the customer’s needs.  Never engage in reflective listening.  And whatever you do, forget the Platinum Rule (treating others the way they want to be treated) – it’s overrated. But seriously. This habit comes down to setting requirements that are well understood by all.  Always restate to the customer what you’re planning on in a language they can understand–getting buyoff earlier saves you a ton of heartache down the road. So many customers hate being bogged down with the technical details of a requirement, and often will tune you out when you start talking about them.  Every implementation detail doesn’t necessarily need to be discussed, but the goals of the implementation do.  Explain the strategy to the customer, not the tactics. Get your PM’s (both project and product) involved in what you’re trying to accomplish at each sprint, even if you have to by force at times.  Far too many managers use the “truck-order-delivery” mentality or some form of the waterfall approach when it comes to software deliverables, and this can lead to disastrous results.  In the blog article referenced above from shirky.com, it mentions that “…the vision of technology as something you can buy according to a plan, then have delivered as if it were coming off a truck, flatters and relieves managers who have no idea and no interest in how this stuff works….it’s also a breeding ground for disaster.”  While it’s important for the highest management levels to see the bigger picture and have more of a bird’s eye view of the product, this should never be the case for project and product managers. Almost 99% of the time, you will be given incomplete requirements, or wishy-washy ones at best. A vision is not a plan, just as a high-fidelity screenshot with lots of pretty graphics is not a website.  Form follows function.  Often times you need to be the one to gather requirements, because either the customer doesn’t know exactly what they want, they don’t want to get bogged down with the details, or they simply don’t know the right questions to ask.  Requirements should be based off a consensus between you and the customer, not one-sided.  Embrace agile, embrace change without too much scope creep, and stop testing in production!  Get feedback as early as possible in the chain. It’s also important to utilize different points of view when it comes to setting requirements.  Not only end-users, but especially BA’s (if you’re lucky enough to have one), other subject-matter experts, as well as product managers should be a part of the process.  Again–setting requirements should be a team effort.  Software engineers are creators just as much as they are builders.  Everyone needs to be involved in the decision-making process.   Question for discussion:  So many customers only want to evaluate things in a production-like environment.  How can we help to ensure early feedback in a more agile way?  How do you best establish requirements for a software project?   #7: Try to over-complicate everything, because purism is king, and you’re awesome  Prematurely optimize your code to adhere purely to every SOLID principle 100% of the time.  Take a philosophical, over-idealistic approach, and always do stuff you just read in that really great academic book from a lifetime CS professor with no practical experience (no offense to CS professors).  Never give in to balancing principle and practice. Make sure the next guy looking at your code (which will probably be you) will have to ask you for clarification on what the heck the code is supposed to be doing. This is because your code needs to make you look smart–so smart that if nobody can maintain it due to its complexity, you can smile knowing you’ve accomplished your goal.  Hooray for job security!  You’re the best now! But seriously. This all comes back to the KISS principle.  Premature optimization is the root of all evil.  In addition, I’d rather copy and paste some logic twice then having to spend hours architecting a more dynamic solution just to handle two use-cases.  Give me a third use-case for a copy-paste, and only then will I seriously consider a more dynamic solution. It’s important to remember that it’s not really about the code, it’s about the business, and understanding why you’re being paid.  You’re being paid to solve business problems, not just to write awesome code. Far too often I’ve seen grandiose ideas, plans, or visions that look great on paper, sound great in a team meeting or a lecture, but simply fail to live up to the hype in reality.  Large, enterprise-level application code bases will always have technical debt and are never perfect.  The reality is that every programmer comes to the codebase with a certain style of doing things, and with varying levels of experience.  Rough consensus and working code is important. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for SOLID principles and design patterns, but these should only be utilized where the objectives are clearly understood by all, and where it’s going to add the most value to the application.  The biggest cost factors with purism is complexity (and sometimes performance), not to mention another developer only being able to understand what’s going on in the code after a lengthy architecture presentation by a senior dev. Try to balance principle and practice.  Extremes to one end or the other are usually bad.   Question for discussion:  How do you best balance principle and practice when it comes to writing clean code?   Bringing it all together In summary, the main thing that all of these habits have in common is ego–more specifically, learning to control your ego by checking it at the door.  They also have to do with managing your own personal brand and being a balanced person.  In managing your brand, as Turnure put it, it’s important to realize that you have a user interface.  If people don’t know what you can do or how well you do it, how will they know to hire you?  How are you marketable at that point? So go out there and be passionate about your work, your brand, and above all, don’t be grumpy. Are you Left Brained or Right Brained?
